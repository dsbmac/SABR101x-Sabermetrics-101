 
ANDY ANDRES: One of the most important figures in Lindsey's third baseball
paper is this one here, Table 1, which is the "Distributions of Scores
in Remainder of the Half-Inning" that he studied.
Now, he combines data from his original first paper in baseball, the 1959
paper, where he looked at bases-loaded data from 1952, '56, '57, and '58.
Those data from the first paper are included in this table
and they're right here.
This is the data from the 1959 paper.
Now, in addition to the 1959 data looking at bases-loaded full,
he collects data from all other base-out situations
from 3,033 half-innings from 1959, 176 different games,
and from 3,366 half-innings from 1960, 197 games.
And that's included here.
This represents the data from 1959-60.
Those are the years that they're from.
This column here are the base states.
"O" means no men on base.
"I" here means man on first, man on second, man on third, first and second,
first and third, second and third, and this is full,
just like he did in the earlier paper, where the bases were full.
So that's represented by the "F" here.
Now, what's also represented here, besides the base state,
is the out state.
He also represents the out state-- 0-outs, 1-out, or 2-outs.
So all the different 24 states of the game are represented in this table.
And what he is plotting here are a couple things.
He's plotting on this table here, he's plotting the number of times
that situation occurred.
The number of times in his data looking at these two sets of games-- 1959
and 1960-- he looked at these sets of games.
And every time a situation occurred with nobody on base and nobody out,
he started recording it.
That happen 6,561 times.
And you can see, all these other states occurred during those games
he was looking at.
So for example, there were only 92 instances
of bases loaded full, nobody out.
In all the games he looked at, it happened 92 times.
All the different base state situations that he analyzed are here.
So only 92 out of about 27,000 times did he reach this state of outs-- 0--
and bases loaded-- full bases.
And so that's what this column represents
is the frequency that these situations occur.
And that's an important column, because that gives part of his value,
when he looks at the batting data, he looks at the situation that is in
and the probability that that situation occurs.
Then he looks at the probability, given that situation,
the probability of scoring zero runs in that situation
for the rest of the inning.
The probability of this column of scoring one run or two runs,
or more than two runs.
This is what he represents in each of these four sets of probabilities.
Each of these probabilities adds up to 1.
And you can convince yourself of that by just adding up these four numbers.
Once you do that, you'll see that it adds up to 1.
So the probabilities here across this row add up to 1.
So the complete set is probability of runs greater than 2, probability of two
runs probability of one run, and probability of zero runs.
Now, the other thing to note, as the outs go from 0 to 1, to 2, just
look at these numbers here, as the outs go from 0 to 1, to 2, it increases.
You're getting an increasing probability of no runs scored.
You're less likely to score runs, as your offense makes more outs.
And this makes complete sense that you change the probability of scoring runs,
zero runs upward, as you make more outs.
But again, all of these four sets of data add up to 1.
One thing to note here is this column also.
This column here is the expected runs, given the bases
and given the number of outs, the expected runs you're going to score.
This is the average runs scored in that situation.
So the average expected runs with nobody on base and 2 outs is 0.102.
You're not expected to score many runs in that situation.
But if you're in a situation, bases loaded, no outs,
your average expected runs goes to 2.22 runs, OK?
Bases loaded, 2 outs, you're expected to score 0.823 runs.
So if you look at the expected runs here that Lindsey demonstrates
based on his half-inning observations, over 6,000 half-inning observations
from these data and then other sets of observations from these data,
you'll see that it sort of makes sense.
At the start of an inning with nobody on, nobody out,
you're expected to score 0.461 runs.
And here's the standard error of all the different situations.
 
Now, one other thing to note in this table
is that you might want to start looking at these two sets of data
and comparing them to see what they look like.
Are they similar?
Is this value here close to this value here?
And if you look and compare these, they're about the same.
Now, these are different data, they don't have to be precisely the same,
but you can see that they are approximately the same, that there
is not much difference in the probability of scoring zero, one, two,
or greater than two runs across these probabilities,
and also in the expected runs you get, when the bases are full, nobody out,
the bases are full, one out, and the bases are full two outs.
And they're about the same in both sets of data--
the '59-'60 data and the '52, '56 '58 data from the 1959 paper,
which is what this section represents.
So this is a very important table that Lindsey puts together.
And what he's doing here is he's talking about the way
to get value and also the way to analyze strategy in the game.
The advisability of a baseball strategy can
be looking at the changing games state.
So if you're, in this situation here, if you're in this situation here,
and you've got nobody on base, and nobody out, but then
that batter hits a triple, you transition to this situation
here-- there's a man on third, and nobody out.
And you transition from expecting to score 0.461 runs at the start
before the triple, then, after the triple,
you're expected to score 1.39 runs after that.
So there's an added expectation of runs.
And you could describe that to the batter who just hit that triple.
The other factor is you can say, when I look
at all triples hit across all these situations,
I can take the probability of being in that situation, which is represented
by these two numbers here-- the top numbers here,
all represented here, above this line here--
those top numbers would be in the numerator.
And this number here 27,027 would go in the denominator
to represent the likelihood of any of these situations.
You can take the probability of being in any of these base-out situations.
Consider what happens, if you hit a home run, a triple, a double, a single.
And then you can see the change in this base state.
You can say the triple goes from this state
that you're in here to this new state.
And we've changed the expected runs from here to here.
Now, what if you make an out?
You can go the other way and look at how outs change expected runs.
Now, Lindsey doesn't look at the out cases
as much as he looks at the hit cases of singles, doubles, triples, and home
runs, but he uses this data table that he
creates of the distribution of scores in the half-inning
to better understand value and to also better understand baseball strategy.
Would you want to intentionally walk someone?
How does it change the base state?
So for example, you might be in this situation here-- man
on second and third, one out.
And the expectation is 1.56 runs.
And if you are the defense, you're thinking, maybe,
I want to walk a batter to load the bases.
Intentional walk here will go from second and third,
one out, to bases loaded, one out.
Well, you've changed your expectations to actually scoring
more runs in that case.
And that may not be the best strategy.
The same thing with men on second and third, zero outs.
You actually increase the expectation of runs by doing that.
So this is the kind of analysis on situation that Lindsay does.
And he also ascribes this to the complete batting profile.
What is the value of a single across all these states?
What's the value of the double, the triple, and the home run?
This is the start of linear weights thinking,
a measure of batting effectiveness is developed here by Lindsey.
Before it was slugging, batting average, RBI,
where the measures of batting effectiveness,
but now he starts developing a new measure of batting effectiveness.
So this new approach to batting effectiveness has three assumptions,
there's three assumptions here.
And let me just iterate them.
The three assumptions here are, first, the purpose of the batter
is to cause runs to score.
So you want to measure how runs are potentially scored, how on average you
approve your run expectation with batting performance.
The second assumption that Lindsey talks about
is that the measure of batting effectiveness of a player
should not depend on the situation, it should be situation independent.
You should measure the batting effectiveness across all situations
and just understand the probability of being in that situation
from this column here.
This column here, again, gives you the probability of being in that situation.
 
And you don't want to really use RBI at all
for the measure of effectiveness of these things.
And third, the probability of making different kinds of hits
should be independent of the situation of the bases.
In other words, not clutch.
But Lindsey says most think that this idea of clutch exists.
But his quote from the paper is that evidence on this point
is difficult to secure.
In other words, evidence for clutch behavior by batters is hard to find,
according to Lindsey.
So this is the basis of run expectancy, it's
the basis that starts linear weights thinking
that leads to Palmer's work, that leads to ideas like Tango's wOBA today
that leads to a value added approach to measuring batting that sabermetricians
have been developing since, really, Lindsey,
but it started reoccurring in the '80s by Palmer and Skoog,
and many other sabermetricians.
Very important table, this idea of linear weights thinking
was started over 50 years ago.
