 
ANDY ANDRES: So on to George Lindsey's third baseball
paper, titled "An Investigation of Strategies in Baseball."
And this is probably Lindsey's most important paper
that really lays the groundwork for sabermetrics for the next 50 years,
frankly.
 
A quote from the paper starts this way, "By collecting statistics
from a large number of baseball games, it
should be possible to examine the probability
distributions of the number of runs resulting
from these various situations.
The object of all choices is to maximize the probability of winning the game."
So winning probability-- the probability of winning the game of baseball--
is part of what Lindsey's getting at in this paper.
He's also looking at probability distributions
of the number of runs in the game of baseball,
based on various situations of the game.
Now, he goes on to analyze baseball strategies by managers and coaches.
He analyzes the question of whether or not to steal a base,
whether or not to use a sacrifice hit-- sacrifice bunt--
with less than two outs.
Should you use the intentional walk and in what situations?
There's a man on first and third, or first, second, and third and the bases
are loaded.
Do you play in to prevent the run from scoring,
or do you play back for the double play?
So all these different situations are analyzed in this paper,
but the reason sabermetricians still study
this paper is because, for the first time,
Lindsay describes run probability based on the situation of the game,
the probability of scoring runs, and he also
describes the probability of winning the game.
So win probability gets defined in this paper, as does run probability.
Now the first thing that Lindsay describes is the probability--
and this is described in his figure one and two from this paper.
Figure one is the probability that the visiting team
will win the game if they are so many runs ahead at the end of the inning.
So what this graph shows you is that if the score is tied,
or if the visiting team is up by one, two, three four, five, or six runs,
or is losing by the same amount as described over here,
this is the winning probability described over the innings.
This is the winning probability graphed out
over the nine innings for the visiting team.
You can see the visiting team is slightly less
at the end of their half-inning of winning the game,
because the home team still has a chance to come to bat and score a run.
Figure two is the probability of winning the game by the home team
if they are this many runs-- as described in the graph-- the runs here
they're behind or ahead.
And you can see how this graph fans out as the game goes on.
In other words, the win probability shifts from the beginning of the game
to the end of the game.
The big conclusion that he makes here is the most valuable runs
in the whole game of baseball, the most valuable runs
are those that tie the score, or put the team one run ahead.
And you can see that.
Going from winning the game by three runs
here, to winning the game by four runs, that run
doesn't add much in win probability in the sixth inning, or the eighth inning,
or even the second inning.
That win probability is only this difference.
The biggest difference is between zero and one when the game is tied
and you go up by one, or when you're behind by one run
and then you tie the game.
Those runs around the tie score, either positively for your team
or negatively for your team, are the most important runs
in the game of baseball.
Because they have the biggest probability of impacting the game,
impacting the winning of the game.
You can also see a real effect as the game goes on.
As the innings move on, and you get closer and closer
to the end of the game, that one run matters so much more.
It has a huge impact on win probability.
And obviously we can go all the way to the ninth inning.
If the game is tied and you score one run,
you impact the game by 50% probability.
You go from a 50% chance of winning the game to 100% chance of winning
the game if you're the home team and you score a run.
So that's a very important run here.
And for those sabermetricians today who like
to understand the progress of the game and the changing win
probabilities by situation, this is the introduction to it.
Lindsay introduces us to this concept of win probability here.
And these graphs show you again that the most valuable runs
are those that tie the score, or put the team one run ahead.
Those are the runs that matter in the game of baseball.
