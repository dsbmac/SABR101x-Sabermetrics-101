 
ANDY ANDRES: The first graph I'll draw is your standard positive correlation
graph with just different observations sort of randomly put around here.
 
The second graph I'm going to draw is not so random anymore,
but on both axes of the same scale.
I'm going to start here and make a curve.
 
So here's my second scatter plot.
My third scatter plot is going to be points like this, not random anymore,
but another point up here.
My fourth scatter plot is just going to be a bunch of numbers
here in the same area and one way out here.
My lines of best fit are all going to fit like this.
They're all going to fit the same.
 
So lines of best fit in each of these different scatter
plots with different observations looks the same.
Let me show you the data sets that actually lead to this case.
Set A, the mean for all the x variables is 9.
The standard deviation is 3.32.
Notice that each of the different sets has exactly the same mean and standard
deviation for their data set here.
You look again in the y variables, exactly the same across the board.
We did bi-variant analyses for each of these sets.
We calculated the mean and standard deviation.
We did scatter plots.
We found the line of best fit.
Now, maybe it's an exercise for the student,
but it turns out the correlation, the r and the line of best fit,
the equation of the line of best fit, from simple linear regression,
both these terms, r and the line of best fit, are the same for all data sets,
as well.
This whole data set of all four different cases has a special name.
It's called Anscombe's Quartet-- Anscombe's Quartet.
Anscombe's Quartet is trying to demonstrate one big principle.
All these four data sets, doing a scatter plot on them, starting
bi-variant analysis on all four data sets, leads
to the same characteristics of the x's and the y's on all the different sets
and the same coefficient of correlation, the r, and the same line of best fit.
But as you see, when you look at the scatter plot,
they look very different, although they come out the same
in the descriptive statistics set of doing bi-variant analysis.
 
The point here is, forever and ever, always look at your scatter plot.
So just like Yogi said, you can observe a lot by watching.
Make sure you observe your scatter plots,
because they're going to tell you something.
Observe them.
Look at them.
See what kind of relationships are there.
Make sure you observe your scatter plots.
