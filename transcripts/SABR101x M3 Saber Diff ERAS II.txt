 
ANDY ANDRES: Because the game in the 19th century
is really not the same game that we see being played today,
and we know of all the rule changes that went on during that time
during the evolution of the game, it's harder
to include those data as part of a normal run scoring environment
analysis.
So what we do is look at the modern era.
The modern era starts in 1901.
So looking at the data from 1901, we see a little bit more consistency.
But even a closer look at these data show potential differences.
So looking at this, you might start clustering groups together.
Yearly trends might be showing up in these data.
Maybe you'd cluster this group together with this funny thing
going on here that's a question mark.
This looks like a consistently era with some outliers.
Here's another consistent era, potentially.
And I'm just clustering groups of data together than the sort of make sense.
And you may or may not agree with that, but this is one way to sort of look
at these data and say maybe these groupings are alike.
And that's very appropriate analyses to help understand potential changes
in the game, rules in the game, how the game is played.
So it is sabermetrics to analyze the game this way for better understanding.
Let's look at these different eras and what they've been called.
This area here is called the dead ball era.
Now it's called the dead ball era for a reason.
The manufacturer of the baseballs themselves was probably inconsistent,
leading to lower coefficient of restitution of the ball,
springiness, or batted ball distance itself.
And the other thing to note is this right here, the use of the same ball.
In this time, they would play with the ball for as long as possible.
And these balls would get hit, and they'd
lose batted ball flight from being hit more.
They'd get darker colored brown and green from use.
So that would certainly impact the ability to see the ball well,
maybe hit the ball well, and also just reduced batted ball flight.
The other thing that was going on here was within the game,
they did not make illegal trick pitches like spit balls
or other balls that impacted the flight.
Pitchers were able to lick their fingers before the pitch
and potentially put other substances on the ball as they delivered the pitch.
So there were a lot more trick pitches in the dead ball era.
And rules changed in 1920.
In 1920 rules changed around the use of spit balls
and the ability for the pitcher to bring their fingers to their mouth
while they're on the pitcher's mound.
So that was a big deal.
The use of trick pitches during the dead ball era, that reduced run scoring.
The batted ball flight and the ability to see the ball reduced run scoring.
So those are potential reasons why runs might
be a little lower in the dead ball era.
The next cluster of data would be this one here.
You might call this group here another cluster of runs that look similar,
a similar run scoring environment.
And this era does have a name in baseball history.
This is the live ball era.
The live ball era is epitomized by the emergence of great home run hitters,
namely Babe Ruth.
Babe Ruth comes along and changes a lot about the game of baseball.
One thing he changes is just the amount of home runs being hit.
Another key factor though, maybe less well known,
is the death of Ray Chapman.
Ray Chapman dies in 1920 on the field.
He gets hit by a ball.
And accounts say he didn't even move during the pitch.
In other words, it looked like he didn't see the ball coming towards his head.
And because there is some speculation that either the background behind him
or the ball being used during the game and not as bright and white and new
as you might want, they changed the rules here to replace the baseballs
as often as possible during the game.
As a direct result of Ray Chapman's death,
they started replacing baseballs a lot more.
And that probably greatly impacted the ability of hitters to see the ball
and potentially impacted the ability of scoring runs.
So this increase in run scoring environment
that we see from around four runs per game by teams to almost five
runs a game by teams, there are many potential explanations for this.
One could be the replacement of the baseball.
The manufacture of the baseball became much more consistent.
And that surely had an impact on batted flight as well.
We look at these data right here.
These data represent the war years, the World War II years are here.
A lot of major league baseball players went to Europe or the Pacific
and fought in the war.
So a lot of replacement players played during these years.
They were different players on major league rosters.
These data are a little separate from other eras
though the war time era of baseball.
But in general, this era here has a name,
and it's called the integration era.
The war years had a dilution of talent, and obviously a very important event
was in 1947 Jackie Robinson joined the major leagues.
And then, because of that, and because of more and more African
Americans joining the major leagues, the Negro Leagues
started to slowly fade away in importance and in number
of participants in the Negro Leagues.
But this is a pretty consistent run scoring environment
given the caveat of the war years being a little different.
The integration era looks like it's a pretty consistent
4.5 runs per game era.
And this is obviously a time when the game becomes much more worldwide, much
more universal for all participants in the world who wanted to play.
A very important factor in thinking about baseball analytics
is the sampling of participants in the game.
But then it looks like something happens here,
following what we call the integration era to 1960.
There are a lot changes in the game from 1960 to today.
There was expansion of teams.
Expansion occurred starting in 1961.
In 1960, there were 16 teams, 16 teams.
And then starting in 1961 until today, now there are 30 teams.
That greatly changes competitive balance, dilution.
So expansion occurred.
Expansion is a big factor that occurred during this time.
Another big thing was in the American League, in the AL,
they adopted the DH rule, the designated hitter rule.
And it changes now the run scoring environment between the two leagues.
You might have more runs scored in the American League
because pitchers aren't going to be batting in the batting lineup anymore.
And another big change occurred in 1969.
In 1968, there was a very low run scoring environment.
That's noted by this outlier right here.
That's 1968.
There were two changes in the game in 1969.
One, they changed the strikes out.
They shrunk it a little bit in the vertical direction.
They lowered the top of the strike zone and raised
the bottom of the strike zone.
And two, they lowered the pitcher's mound.
 
And what this did is took away some advantage
of the picture of throwing downhill.
So you could imagine the pitching mound was 15 inches above the level ground,
now it became 10 inches above the level ground.
And potentially the trajectory of the pitches changed by five inches
or so and that might have changed the ability of hitters
to actually hit the ball in the strike zone.
So those two changes were very big two.
So a lot of things happen from 1960, from 1960 all the way
to the modern game today.
So how do we characterize this era?
How do we analyze this era?
In other words, what do we call this area or eras in this time frame?
