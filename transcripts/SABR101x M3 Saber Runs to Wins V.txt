ANDY ANDRES: So considering these two columns,
I wanted to go through how we calculated these different numbers here,
these percentages.
What we did was, for each estimator, the Cook estimator, for example,
the Cook estimator, we just got the absolute difference of the estimator
to the actual winning percentage for every team season in the dataset.
So in this column here, we're talking over 2,300 observations, where
each of the estimators was compared to the actual winning percentage.
And we took the difference-- made it an absolute difference,
so we got rid of the negative values-- and we just took an average.
So this is the average, absolute difference
for each estimator in the actual percentage.
So this looks at how close each estimator got,
and the winner was the Kross estimator.
The Kross estimator did a nice job estimating the actual winning
percentage of all those teams' seasons.
So for the larger dataset in the modern era--
and if you ever did analyses that encompassed the whole dataset,
and you needed to think about winning-percentage estimators,
you might want to go with the best one in this list, which
is the Kross estimator.
The Kross estimator is the lowest of this column.
Again, it's pretty close.
I would say that these five are all fairly good.
The Cook estimator seems like a little bit further apart than the rest,
but these five do a nice job, and the best was Kross.
So if you need more precision, go with that one
if you're looking at large datasets encompassing the modern era.
But if you're thinking about more recent times, looking at this column,
you might want to go with the Pythagorean 1.3 exponent estimator.
That did the best of the whole group.
And again, it looks like the Cook winning-percentage estimator
was the furthest off, where these five estimators were fairly close.
But now let's talk about a very important concept
in all of Sabermetrics.
This idea, again, coming full circle in this track,
the idea, again, of runs to wins.
How many runs equals a win?
When you answer the question, how many runs make a win, the rule of thumb
is 10.
It's approximately 10 runs per win, and this approximation
works pretty well for most things.
So if we are ever doing analyses that yield
us runs-- maybe runs created for batters, maybe runs saved for fielders,
maybe runs created for base runners, runs saved from outfield arms,
runs saved from catcher framing-- whatever we're looking at,
and we can get to runs, we can always do the approximation.
10 runs is one win.
So we can say, if a shortstop saves 20 runs with his defense, well,
that's about two wins a year for that shortstop as a defender.
But we can take these formulae.
We can take these winning-percentage estimators.
And remember the basis of all these formulas.
They all involved runs scored by the offense,
and runs allowed by the defense.
Let me show you a quick graphic here of our query
that gave us these winning-percentage estimators.
And here it is.
Let's look at each of these six estimators we've talked about.
Cook relies on runs and runs allowed.
Soolman, same thing-- runs scored, number of games
played, runs allowed, number of games played.
The Bill Kross winning-percentage estimator-- runs scored by the offense,
runs allowed.
That's what's in the formula.
Same thing with Smith, and same thing with the Bill James Pythagorean
versions of winning-percentage estimators.
All these winning-percentage estimators look at runs.
So what if we now replace in any of these equations
the runs saved, or the runs earned, or created,
by batting or other parts of the game?
So if we can break down parts of the game to runs,
and we know whether it's offense or defense,
we can start putting them in these formulas, and estimating the wins.
This is the basis of a very common statistic
talked about today, which is WAR.
WAR stands for Wins Above Replacement.
And when you do WAR analyses-- when you try to estimate WAR as a statistic,
getting at value of player, you always get to wins.
Well, how do you get to wins?
Well, you get it through runs.
You have different runs estimators for different parts of the game,
and you can use these more precise winning-percentage formulas
to get at how many wins somebody contributes.
Let me run you through a quick example of this.
But in general, we can improve upon this notion of, oh, it
takes 10 runs per win.
10 runs for a win-- well, how do we improve that?
Well, let's look at, say, our favorite here, which
is the Bill James Pythagorean theorem with the 1.83 exponent.
Winning percentage is runs to the 1.83 power,
divided by runs to the 1.83 power, plus runs allowed to the 1.83 power.
Add those together.
They're in the denominator.
Do this calculation, and we have a very good estimate of winning percentage.
But now, if we know a certain shortstop saves us 20 runs,
we can reduce the runs allowed here in our formula,
and know how much our winning percentage is going to increase.
And then when we know the winning percentage increase,
we can actually start calculating.
The winning percentage is, by definition, wins over wins plus losses.
This just represents games.
This is the term for games played.
 
So we can get at wins through these various win-percentage estimators.
 
So this is the heart of modern analyses and Sabermetrics.
You want to get at runs.
