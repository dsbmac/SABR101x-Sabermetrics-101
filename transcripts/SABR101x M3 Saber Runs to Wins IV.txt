 
ANDY ANDRES: So this is the SQL query I ran
to look at winning percentage estimators.
So let's go look at some of the plots I made of these data.
 
This is the data from 1901 to 2013.
All these data points, each point here is a team season, team season.
And we just put a best fit line here through these data.
We plotted the actual winning percentage of each team and their seasons
in the modern era.
The actual winning percentage is always on the x-axis here.
And we used the Cook estimator.
Remember what the Cook estimator was.
It was 0.484 times runs over runs allowed.
This term get you the estimate of the winning percentage.
So you take the runs the team scored, the runs allowed by that team.
But in this formula, you predict the winning percentage of that team.
And that's what this represents.
This is a pretty tight correlation.
The coefficient of determination is a very high 0.88646.
Let's move through some of the others.
The next five I'm going to show are all the 1901 to 2013 modern era data set.
So let's look at those.
The next winning percentage estimator is Arnie Soolman--
winning percentage estimator.
That's 0.89622.
0.89622 is his coefficient of determination
in the 1901 to 2013 data set.
So this is the Bill Kross winning percentage estimator.
And the coefficient of determination is 0.90137.
Here's the David Smith winning percentage estimator, 0.90123.
Here's the Bill James with the exponent of two winning percentage estimator.
And here's the Bill James estimator with the exponent 1.83.
I'm going to do a summary table later to talk
about how close these estimators are and how we can distinguish them.
But now let's look at the second data set here.
This is a smaller data set.
What we're looking at here are data from 1955 to 2013.
And again, this is a somewhat arbitrary choice
because I like starting a lot of analyses at 1955
when I do sabermetrics.
What's odd here is that we lose a great team, the 1954 Cleveland Indians.
They were a fabulous team with a wonderful winning percentage.
Yet they're not in this data set.
So the team with the highest actual winning percentage out here
is the Seattle Mariners, 2001.
Seattle Mariners in 2001 is this data point right here.
We're showing here again the coefficient of determination
in this data set for the Earnshaw Cook ratio estimator.
Remember what that was again.
It was 0.484 times runs divided by runs allowed
gets you these data here on this side that are plotted off this axis.
So let's run through these data.
Remember these data sets are 1955 to 2013.
Here's the Cook Estimator, the Soolman estimator, the Kross Estimator,
David Smith's estimator, Bill James exponent
two estimator, Bill James exponent 183.
So shortly, I'll get to a summary table including all these coefficients
of determination in these two sets of six winning percentage estimators.
But before that, I want to do something a little unconventional.
I want to scroll through these graphs fairly quickly through my Powerpoint
deck here so you get a sense of how similar these clusters of observations
are around the line of best fit.
OK?
So I'm going to scroll back through the sixth 1955
through 2013 team season observations about winning percentage for each
of the six estimators.
So there's the different ones.
And just get a glancing sense of how well
these data cluster around the line of best fit.
They really do go together.
Now, let's go forward to the bigger data set, the 1901 to 2013 team season data
set.
There's over 2,300 observations in this data set.
And again, the clustering of the observations
around the line of best fit is what I want to show you here,
the clustering of the observations around the line of best fit.
Bottom line, these estimators do a pretty decent job.
They get very close to the actual winning percentage.
And let's go through a table to talk about these differences in the two
different data sets and plus the six different estimators.
 
Here's a table summarizing the coefficients of determination
for each of the six estimators.
There are four columns here for each of the six win percentage estimators,
trying to summarize how close each of the estimators
actually were the team winning percentage, the actual team winning
percentage.
These first two columns we'll discuss shortly.
But these are the two columns of coefficients of determination
that we've been showing you.
And as you can see, when comparing these coefficients of determination,
hopefully you get a sense how close they are, how similar they all are.
And there's a slight difference in magnitude between the larger data
set and the smaller data set, which is explained just by sample size.
But just look within the column how similar they all are.
Now, if you have to choose the highest coefficient of determination,
it would be this one here for the bigger data
set starting in the modern era and this one here for the 1955, 2013 data set.
But these numbers are very close to these two numbers,
so the two different Bill James Pythagorean
win percentage estimators did a nice job.
But you're really picking nits if you think this is a whole lot better
than the Smith version or the Kross version.
So all in all, the take home message here is yes, we can pick the best.
And if we really need more precision in this, we should go with the best.
But they're all very similar and they all do a nice job.
