 
ANDY ANDRES: For module three, in the History of Sabermetrics track,
we're going to look at F.C. Lane, Ferdinand Cole Lane.
And F.C. Lane grew up in Massachusetts on Cape Cod
after being born in Minnesota.
And he graduated from Boston University in 1907.
A little shout out to BU as being hot bed for Sabermetrics.
But F.C. Lane, like the others we've covered
before him, Fullerton and Chadwick, was a writer.
He was the editor for many, many years of a monthly called the Baseball
Magazine.
And over his time as a writer for the Baseball Magazine
and an editor of the Baseball Magazine, he wrote over 1,000 pieces on baseball.
And one of his little niches, because it was the Baseball Magazine,
he was able to write longer features than some of the other newspaper
writers of the day.
Since he liked to travel, he would travel in the off-season
to players' off-season homes and do feature articles
more in depth about who they were and what
they liked to do in their off-season.
He also wrote a lot about the game, talking about the science of the game
and how the game was played in the dead ball era.
A lot of researchers look at his articles
mainly for biographical information, because they
were so expensive and thorough.
He also wrote a very important book that's been reprinted multiple times,
called Batting.
He wrote it in 1925, and in it, he's got extensive interviews with batters
and how they approached their craft.
So another important book trying to capture the players of the day
and how they approached batting.
Now after he retired from baseball in 1937, he retired to Cape Cod,
but he did spend three years after his retirement as chairman of the History
department at a small college in Georgia.
But generally after his retirement, he traveled.
He traveled with his wife multiple times, and they circumvented the globe.
He wrote books about travel.
He even traveled to both the North Pole and the South Pole.
As someone who teaches biology at Boston University today,
I found it interesting that F.C. Lane's first job out of college
was as a field biologist for the state of Massachusetts.
Given his extensive writing career and all the various things
he did over his 99 years while on the planet,
I think it's fair to call him a Renaissance Man.
But he's distinguished himself in the baseball world
for his biography of other players at the time and for his early attempts
at Sabermetrics.
So let's review some of the material he wrote that is important today.
One thing he was noted for was a scientific approach to the game,
thinking about the game more thoroughly.
This was very similar to Fullerton.
Fullerton approached the game as an observationist,
thinking about what he was seeing and asking questions.
One of the conclusions Lane came up with was
that batting averages were "worse than worthless."
Now that's something he wrote.
He spent many articles trying to make the case that the fans and the game
itself, the people keeping the record of the game,
should move away from batting average.
 
So even though Lane never made much headway
on his crusade to move away from batting average
as the gold standard for hitting performance,
he kept at it during his career as a baseball writer.
Sabermetricians have studied F.C. Lane and looked at as work.
We've included all the PDFs of his most important papers
and articles for all of the students here to read,
but he does sort of this early run expectancy data.
He does look at the run value of a certain baseball event, singles,
doubles, triples home runs, walks.
The other articles he wrote that were very important
that are still referred to are his articles
on pitching science, team makeup, base stealing science.
Interesting to consider that questions regarding the players' makeup
were being asked even back 100 years ago.
So all in all, F.C. Lane is a figure worth studying in Sabermetrics,
and let's talk about some of his key articles.
One article he wrote was called, "How Runs are Scored."
And he's looking here at the comparative importance of singles, triples,
errors, all the rest as a factor in scoring runs.
And the way he does it, is he looks at run scoring events
and decides what was the play that led to that run.
In other words, which baseball event led to a run scoring event.
And about 40% of the time, it was a single that drove in the run.
Sometimes it was doubles, errors, home runs, triples.
So you see the list here of the various ways runs
were scored, the various events that led to runs being scored.
And that's a pretty good way to start looking
at the value of each of these events in terms of run scoring.
The other study he did in one of his articles
was looking at batted ball types.
He did a nice little study of bat-ball impact, the batted ball types
off the bat.
He continued his interest in studying the game more in an article called,
"Batting or Fielding, Which?"
What's interesting here in this article, he's
trying to get at which is more important,
a team full of great batters or a team full of great fielders?
And he separates out the pitching from fielding in terms of defense.
He discusses this idea that the game is half defense and half
offense, half scoring runs and half preventing runs,
but he doesn't talk about the pitching on purpose.
He decides, let's just look at the fielding component.
And he puts together a case study looking at a team with great fielders
and not so great batters and then another team comparing that
to another team with great batters but not so great fielders.
And he comes to the conclusion that batting
is much more important than fielding in terms of value to the game,
in terms of trying to win the game.
So he concludes that you should worry about getting great batters
over getting nine players with great gloves.
 
Then we get to the key study that Sabermetricians always refer back to.
This is the 1916 article called, "Why the System of Batting Averages
Should be Changed."
And this is where he estimates the value of a single, double, triple, home run.
This is mostly a theoretical paper where he's trying to make the case,
and he calls for a revolution.
He calls for everybody to stop thinking about batting average
and start thinking about the value of different types of hits.
One of the great quotes about this concept comes from this article.
And this is F.C. Lane, "Why would a system that placed nickels, dimes,
quarters, fifty cent pieces on the same basis, be much of a system
whereby to compute a man's financial resources.
And yet it is precisely such a loose, inaccurate system
which obtains in baseball."
And this is his argument why batting average is not ideal,
because it equally values home runs, triple, doubles, and singles.
He goes on in this article to make the case
and put theoretical values on a single, double, triple, and a home run.
And the way he does it, he gives two values to each of the hits.
The one value is how far around the batter actually
makes it towards scoring a run.
So a batter gets a single, gets 1/4 of a run,
because he makes it 1/4 way around the bases.
A triple gets 3/4 of a run value because you get 3/4 of the way around.
But obviously understanding that the hit also advances runners that are on base,
he assumes that 1/3 of the time there will
be runners on base on different bases.
And from that assumption about the times a runner is actually on base
and then the movement of those runners around the bases based on the hit type,
he comes up with a decent theoretical model
of the value of each of these hits towards advancing runners,
not just the batter runner himself.
And as you can see, his numbers get very close.
Here's what he puts the value for each of the events.
This table here is a summary of a theoretical game
that Lane goes through.
A single is given 40% of a run, 40% of a run is a single.
Doubles get 65% of a run, triple 90% of a run, home runs 1.15% of a run.
Walks get 0.25% of a run.
Errors get 0.375 runs, and stolen bases are at 25% of a run.
He adds these up and gets 7.75 runs from these offensive events.
 
So here's his value again.
Singles are 0.4 of a run, doubles 0.65, triples 0.9, home
runs 1.15 of a run, walks 0.25, errors 0.375, and stolen bases 0.25 of a run.
That's his conclusion, and it's theoretical.
He's just doing this by observation.
The next paper is where he gets empirical.
And he starts trying to put observation to this theoretical idea.
The next paper is, "Why the System of Batting Averages should be Reformed."
Very similar title, but he uses reformed instead of the word change.
So let's look at the data he presents in this article.
And he presents a table for singles, doubles, triples.
I don't show the home runs table, but it's there as well.
This is observational now, and he observes
how many runners advanced on those singles.
He also includes an analysis of fielder's choices here.
And instead of just looking at the advancement of the runners, which
is the section here, total bases gained, what he looks at also
are runs scored or driven in.
How many runs were scored as a result of that single.
And finally he puts together his summary table.
This is a summary table of the article.
This is where he puts a value on a run.
He says a single is worth 0.46 runs, double 0.79 runs, triple 1.15 runs,
and home runs are 1.55 runs.
This is an early attempt on a small sample size
to try to get at value of runs.
These analyses have been more advanced since then obviously.
This is 100 years ago almost.
We'll talk about that in module four, looking
at runs estimators when we look at the Sabermetrics track.
But this is a fabulous start to try to get away from batting average.
F.C. Lane really tries to make the empirical case
of the value of different hit events as opposed to just putting them
all on equal playing field as is done with batting average.
And remember, batting average was the standard of the time.
And in his earlier paper, he makes the clear case
of the value of Gabby Crabbith versus the batting champion Jake Daubert.
So I encourage you to read all these articles by F.C. Lane.
We include the PDFs on the edX platform.
And that's the end of module three.
