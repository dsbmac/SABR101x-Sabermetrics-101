 
ANDY ANDRES: So let's continue on our look
at other measures of spread or variability
in our descriptive statistics section.
We use this column right here to help us calculate average absolute deviation.
We took this term, divided it by N, and we
got a sense of the variability of all elements of the data set
from a measure of central tendency, the mean.
And that's what this column represents.
There's another way to get variability around a central tendency--
the spread of the data around a central tendency.
And that's through the variance and standard deviation.
And for now, I'm just going to share the formula with you.
But it's sort of similar to the idea of the average absolute deviation.
But instead of taking the difference from the mean,
we're taking the difference when the mean and squaring that term.
 
And this also creates positive values.
When you square the value, you're always going
to create positive values throughout the data set.
So in the same way the absolute value created positive values
that we can add together, we also do that for the square term.
Each of the numbers in this column represent a measurement
of the difference of the original data point to a centralized number--
the mean here, in this case.
So again, 54 was the term farthest away from the mean,
and it has the highest value in this column.
The square difference from the mean is the highest.
And the closest, again, is 5.54.
It happens twice.
So we know here that the 23 data point is
the closest to the mean, represented by how low these two values are.
So this is a key number here.
And I'll show you why in the formula, when
we calculate both the variance and the standard deviation.
So let's go to the formula now.
So here's the formula to calculate variance.
Variance is represented by S squared.
And in the formula, we've got the N term.
Now N is the familiar number of data points in the data set.
In our case, N is 17 in our sample data set.
So N occurs here and here in the formula.
This sigma term essentially says, go through all
of the elements in the data set, from 1 to 17.
And here is 17.
So using the term I as the subscript, it's saying, take the data point.
And the 17 data points are represented right here in the Home Run column.
These are the 17 data points that, in turn, we're
going to use in this sigma bracket.
This sigma term here says, go from 1 to 17,
taking the difference between the data point--
the data point here-- and the mean.
So take the data point X, subtract the mean,
which is here, data point X. Subtract the mean and square the term.
So it turns out this column here is the sum term here, the sigma term here.
And the number, 3577.88.
It's the sum of the data point difference from the mean.
Square that term.
Add it all together.
That's 3577.88.
That number divided by N minus 1, the number of samples in the data
set-- that divided by 16 equals 223.62.
That's our variance in our sample data set.
We calculated it pretty easily inside a spreadsheet.
To get this number, we divide by N minus 1.
Now.
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
So when I take the square root of this number, it turns out to be 14.95.
So we've run you through an example of how
to calculate the variance and the standard deviation of a certain data
set.
Coefficient of variation, CV, is a useful way
to compare these measures of spread or variability.
If we had a data set with much larger numbers than this--
maybe we're measuring something with much higher quantities--
the standard deviation would be much higher.
So let's clean that slide out and start talking more
about coefficient of variation, CV.
CV, coefficient of variation.
The coefficient of variation is defined as S, the standard deviation,
divided by the mean.
And here's our symbol for mean.
So the standard deviation divided by the mean is the coefficient of variation.
 
And what's really useful about the coefficient of variation
is it can compare data sets.
 
So data sets can now be compared, and you
can get a sense of the measures of spread or variability.
Because coefficient of variation is a dimensionless variable.
It's not like it's measuring homeruns or how far
a baseball can be thrown in feet.
There's no units to the coefficient of variation.
And it does give you some sense of the measure
of spread of variability in a data set.
You don't have to worry about the means of the data set.
You can have widely different means and widely different units
and widely different just straight numbers--
the actual quality of the numbers.
So coefficient of variation turns out to be very useful
when comparing data sets.
