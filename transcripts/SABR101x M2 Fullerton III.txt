ANDY ANDRES: So now let's talk about Hugh Fullerton, scientist.
There are two key articles that Fullerton
wrote that I want to review that are very scientific in nature.
The first one actually measures many different parameters
relating to baseball performance on Babe Ruth.
So after a day game in which Babe Ruth actually hits a home run,
Fullerton takes Ruth up to Columbia University
to get tested on many different scientific measures
to see how he performs.
 
And shortly after that, the New York Times
has a headline in the Sunday edition on the front page titled
"Ruth: Supernormal."
So he hits homers.
Supernormal is the adjective for Babe Ruth.
And that's actually pretty accurate, because when
you look at the data described in Fullerton's article,
he is better than normal on all the measures that they did.
So one of them was reaction times, and this
is to both visual stimuli and audio stimuli.
And Ruth was much better than normal.
Supernormal.
They also measured hand-eye coordination,
and this is where Ruth was off the charts.
His scores were off the charts on the tests of hand-eye coordination.
They also took a measure which is described
in this graphic here of his breathing while he was swinging a baseball bat,
trying to hit a baseball.
And they claim that, because he holds his breath,
he actually reduces performance.
And this is where they get the claim Babe
could beat his own record if he only didn't hold his breath.
Now, I'm not exactly sure the physiology there,
but that was Fullerton's claim and maybe the claim from the Columbia scientists,
as well.
They also did tests of mental acuity.
 
In other words, how quickly someone could perform a task.
So tests of the mind were also included that day for Babe Ruth.
And he surpassed the norm in each and every one of these tests.
So, subsequently, in the PDF you see after this video,
they make the claim that Babe Ruth's home run secrets are solved by science.
So his reaction times, his extraordinary, off the charts
hand- eye coordination, and his mental acuity
were all pieces of the puzzle leading to his superior baseball performance.
 
Now, Fullerton is very excited, and he writes,
the secret of Ruth's ability to hit is clearly revealed in these tests.
His eye, his ear, his brain and nerves all function more rapidly
than those of the average person.
Further, the coordination between the eye, ear, brain, and muscle
is much nearer perfection than that of the normal, healthy man.
So Fullerton does some science, collects data on an extraordinary baseball
performer of the day, and it actually contributes
to some of the physiological and maybe psychological literature that's
grown since the time of Babe Ruth.
So Fullerton, in pushing Ruth to do this, actually contributes to science.
So I encourage you to go read the PDF that we've included after this video.
But next, I want to talk about another contribution
to science and another article he wrote.
He wrote an article in the American Magazine
in 1912 called "The Physics of Baseball."
And he contributes a lot to the understanding of curve balls
and how they work.
He writes it for a broad audience, and he describes, basically,
the science of curving baseballs.
That's the whole purpose of this article.
One of the stories he tells in the article
is about Harvard professors who doubted that baseballs really
could curve in reality.
They understood the theory that baseballs should be able to curve
if spun correctly, but they just didn't think
humans could spin it that quickly so that they could actually curve in air.
There was a player, a pitcher catcher, named Jim Tyng on the Harvard baseball
team.
So the professors at Harvard arranged a demonstration
so that they could actually prove to themselves that the ball did actually
deflect on its trajectory because of the spinning nature of the ball
itself and not just gravity or any other deflection that was sort of well known.
So that's one thing that Fullerton covers
in this article is that story of the Harvard professors and Harvard baseball
player Jim Tyng.
Then he goes on to say, perhaps the most frequent question
asked of the baseball writer is, how far can a ball be made to curve?
And because Fullerton was a catcher himself and a baseball
player and a real close observer of the game,
he doesn't think a baseball can curve more than 20 inches between the 56
feet of the release by the pitcher to when it crosses home plate
and is caught by the catcher.
So 20 inches is his speculation.
Now, some players that interviewed for the article talk
about it breaking up to five feet or just some smaller number,
like six inches is the max that it could break.
But Fullerton suspects it could be up to 20 inches.
So what he does after that is run an experiment
to measure the movement of the curve ball.
And this is really interesting.
There was a Chicago Cubs pitcher named Orville Overall,
and Fullerton thought he had the best curve ball in baseball.
So they set up an experiment where they put big-- I'm going to draw home plate
and then pitcher's mound way out here where Orville is-- what they did
is put up a bunch of tissue screens, 12 in all.
Four were kind of spread out more broadly,
but eight were closely put together right near home plate.
 
Now, these were big screens that the ball could pass through easily,
and you could sort of see in two dimensions
where it broke through the tissue paper.
So if a curve ball-- if I'm looking from a bird's eye view,
and this is the release point of Orville Overall's curve ball,
maybe the trajectory kind of moves like this and curves this way.
The theory was that you'd be able to see where the ball penetrated these tissue
screens and recreate a three-dimensional picture of the trajectory
of the baseball by doing this set up with these screens and tissue paper.
So this is a real experiment that Fullerton sets up to collect data.
And what he shows subsequently, by analyzing the path of the ball
through these tissue screens, is that the deflection is 17 inches.
17 inches is the deflection of the curve ball thrown
by one of the best curve ball pitchers of the day, Orville
Overall of the Cubs.
And when we look at PITCHf/x data today, that's a pretty good curve ball.
That's about what you get maximally in terms of deflection.
So this is right in the ballpark of what we can measure today
with much better technology.
This is old school technology, tissue screens
that can actually see it move and recreate
a three-dimensional view of how the ball moves
in space by using these two-dimensional screens.
Again, Hugh Fullerton, acting like a scientist and collecting data to help
understand the curve ball curving through three dimensions,
through air, and understanding better the physics of baseball.
So Fullerton gets involved in many aspects, writing about the game,
analyzing the game, observing the game, and trying
to run experiments to better measure the physics and the physiology
and the psychology of the performers of the game.
