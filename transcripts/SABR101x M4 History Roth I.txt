ANDY ANDRES: For this module we're going to be
looking at Allan Roth in our History of Sabermetrics track.
Allan Roth has a very interesting story, but just some facts--
he really did take analytics to a new level
and do very innovative things people hadn't been doing before.
And the other thing was he was the first full time
employee for a club to do this sort of work.
The story goes Allan Roth was interested in numbers.
He grew up in Canada and started analyzing hockey games,
keeping track of numbers when he was in the war-- he actually
kept track of statistics for the war effort.
So he has a lifelong fascination with numbers,
and he thought he could help the Dodgers and Branch Rickey, in particular.
So in 1944 after leaving the military during World War II,
he sent Roth a letter where he proposed tracking
lots of different things in a baseball game-- batted ball location,
pitch types, the count at which batted balls were hit,
splits for righty lefty, day night splits, ballpark effects
to try to better understand how stats changed in different ballparks,
base out situations, and home road splits.
And when Roth met Rickey he was very intrigued by Roth's ideas
and pressed upon the Dodgers to hire Allan Roth full time
to help the Dodgers win.
It took until April 1947 though for the visa to clear.
It was the war effort and I think visas were harder
to clear between Canada and the US.
So for three years or so, maybe a little less, Allan Roth had a job
but couldn't really work.
When he started working in 1947-- interestingly on the same day
that Jackie Robinson started with the Dodgers--
the way he kept track of everything for every game
he had a 17 by 14 inch sheet which recorded all this information
that I just spoke of-- batted ball location count--
and he started compiling statistics based on that.
And every game had its chart and data set that he was collecting,
and for 18 seasons he charted all these games.
Now a significant event happened in 1950,
which wasn't too far into his tenure working for the Dodgers.
Branch Rickey took a job with the Pittsburgh Pirates,
and Allan Roth stayed on with the Dodgers.
There was new management and they moved him from his preferred seat
behind home plate up to the press box.
And he couldn't really recognize pitches anymore,
so he stopped recording pitch types.
He was a little frustrated by the new seat,
but he kept plugging away collecting all the other data that he could.
And he got more and more involved in media
relations for the Dodgers working with the broadcast teams and the writers
to give them statistics as needed.
So that was the broad outline of what Allan Roth has contributed--
this massive effort of data collection.
Massive.
You can think about 18 seasons worth of data-- 154 games
and then transitioning to 162 games.
And Branch Rickey, he wrote, in my opinion,
Allan Roth was the top statistical specialist in baseball.
And later on, Bill James said he was the guy who began it all.
He took statisticians into a brave new world.
One of the key things I really want to analyze is the Life 1954 article.
You should have read that before looking at these videos.
It's really quite fascinating and it's one of the premier things
to read for new sabermetricians.
It's a key thing to read so that they appreciate work that was done previous
to the modern era in sabermetrics.
So the Life 1954 article was a key moment for Allan Roth
and for Branch Rickey, and frankly, for sabermetrics.
So I hope you enjoyed reading it.
In there you read that Life magazine actually asked Rickey
if there could be formulated a way to measure value better
for all the different elements of a game.
So that was the beginning of this article.
Life came to Rickey and said, "Can you develop a kind of formula
to do this kind of valuation?"
And Rickey was a little skeptical, but he talked to Allan Roth
and they worked together in the run up to this article.
And on August 2, 1945, Life published their article,
"Goodbye to Some Old Baseball Ideas."
And in it, here is some quotes: "Baseball people
are generally allergic to new ideas."
This article explains a device for measuring baseball,
revealing startling truths about the nature of the game.
And accurate important factors which contribute to winning and losing games.
And what Branch Rickey also said was it was the most constructive thing
to come into baseball in his memory.
So here's the start of what they do.
And I want to go through this chart and explain it.
This is the first figure in the paper, but let's explain it
because it leads to the formula that Rickey also reports.
So let's walk through this chart.
This is the 1953 National League standings, and what we have here
are games behind.
The National League winner that year was the Brooklyn Dodgers and all
the other teams were pretty far behind as it as it turns out.
And what we have here is O. Now remember this.
O and D are parts of the formula that we're
going to describe in the next slide.
But that's the formula that Rickey and Roth come up with.
What we're graphing here is runs per game.
This is our per game for the Brooklyn Dodgers,
and this is runs allowed per game by the Brooklyn Dodgers.
O minus D is this column here.
That's just the subtraction.
You can do it.
You can look over the numbers and see that it's
this number minus this number equals this number.
Pretty straightforward math.
So this is what we would call the run differential.
This is the run differential commonly referred to today
as the run differential.
 
But this is the first time run differential
is analyzed systematically and used to better understand
how to win baseball games.
So Roth and Rickey start describing the run differential.
I think all baseball writers and fans and general managers and people
in the game understood that run differential was key,
but what Roth and Rickey do is start talking about run differential
as a number and building a formula leading to O.
They're modeling something here.
Now they're modeling offense and they're modeling defense.
These are models that they build up that you read about.
These are the models that model offense and model defense,
and the whole idea now is to start predicting games behind
from these models.
That's what Rickey calls his efficiency in certain places.
So you can see it's pretty straightforward math
and once again, this predates efforts by Earnshaw Cook and others
to look at winning percentage estimators.
This really was a first look at the standings order of a team
and the run differential of the team and how it goes with the standings--
the rank order of the standings as they finish the season.
So what's next?
What's next is to look at the actual formula
that Roth and Rickey come up with to model these games behind,
to model the idea that we can predict through different measurements 0:09:56.484,1193:02:47.295  
where teams will end up, how many runs they'll score, how their offense will
do, how their defense will do, to get at final standings
and how many wins a team might get.
