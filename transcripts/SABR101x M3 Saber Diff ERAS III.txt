 
ANDY ANDRES: So in the last video segment,
we left you with this question.
What to call this era starting around 1960?
As opposed to the other eras-- the Integration Era,
which is here, the Live Ball Era, which is here,
and the Dead Ball Era, which is here.
What do we call this era here following these other well known eras?
Well, a lot of things are going on in this time and let's review
some of the potential effects of what might be changing in the run scoring
environment since 1960.
Some people call this the Expansion Era.
Starting in 1961, they went from 16 teams to 30 teams.
And here's a diagram representing expansion.
These thinner arrows here are always two teams being added to the league
and this thicker arrow here is when four teams were added in 1969.
You can see the expansion here and potentially,
if you want to try to analyze it, maybe there's
a change in run scoring environment with expansion.
Now that's a good hypothesis.
People should test that.
People have looked at that.
Another thing you might want to call it is the Designated Hitter Era.
In 1973, right here in 1973, the American league
started the designated hitter rule.
Did it change the run scoring environment?
Well, it's hard to see, but to really do that, you want to compare the AL where
they have the DH to the NL where there is no DH.
And the pitchers actually have to bat in the lineup.
So maybe this era should be called the Designated Hitter Era.
Maybe it's called the Free Agency Era.
The economics of the game drastically changed in the mid '70s
as they added free agency.
Did that change their run scoring environment?
Potentially.
Worth studying and worth asking about anyway.
And there's also the Interleague Play Era.
In the mid '90s, they started interleague play,
where the American league teams would play the national league
teams at least in a small subset of the schedule
during the regular season, as opposed to the post season in the World Series.
So maybe the interleague play has something
to do with the run scoring environment.
The wild card started in the mid to early '90s.
Maybe it's the Wild Card Era.
Maybe that explains the changing run scoring environments here.
But this other era here, this sort of era from the mid '90s
on, people have called it the Long Ball Era, the Power Era, the Steroid Era.
It was a time of higher run scoring, mimicking the Live Ball Era here.
You can see how the run scoring environments
is very similar to these data points here.
Teams just going about five runs per game in all their games
during the season on average.
And so this could be explained potentially by the increase in power,
potentially the increase in steroid usage by players.
All these things might explain what's going on there,
but it's worth discussing.
Now this is sort of my take on it.
I think expansion probably had some impact on the game,
maybe the run scoring environments.
There are certainly years where it seems to have a greater impact.
And then there's this other Power Era.
Now I don't call it the Steroid Era, just because it's not clear to me
that steroids are the main cause here of this increased run scoring environment.
Certainly there's more power.
That's demonstrable.
You can see more home runs.
Slugging goes up.
All measures of power increase during this time.
But the Expansion Era goes from 1961 at least to that early '90s expansion.
It doesn't include the last expansion in '98 that had the Rockies and the Rays
come into the league-- actually the Devil Rays at the time.
But this is a decent enough explanation for these eras
that have occurred since then.
Now this graph only goes to 2010.
There's been a few years since then.
Let's review what's happened to run scoring since 2010.
In 2010, the run scoring on average here, the runs per game for all teams,
was 4.4-- 4.38, let's call it 4.4.
In 2011, it went down to 4.3.
And 2012, what happened to the run scoring environment?
It stayed at 4.3.
This is actually 4.28 and this is 4.32.
Not to quibble, those are essentially the same.
Now in 2013, it went down a little bit more to 4.17, we'll call that 4.2.
So there's a slight trend here since 2010 of decreasing run scoring.
This has occurred and analysts have sort of seen this
and there's different explanations for this.
We'll talk about that in a few slides, but the next question I want to address
is this question of is there a league difference?
We'll end this video segment and in the next video segment
go on to discussion of league differences in run scoring.
