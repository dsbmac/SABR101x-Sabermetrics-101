 
ANDY ANDRES: Continuing our exploration of runs and wins, let's talk about one
of the seminal contributions of Bill James.
Bill James, among many innovations in sabermetrics,
started a whole lot of work when he created the Pythagorean Theorem.
Now, people before him had looked at winning percentage estimators
and we'll review that, but Bill James comes up with the Pythagorean Theorem.
And it's based on that geometrical principle about triangles.
If you remember your triangle, the relationship
is A squared equals B squared plus C squared, where
the length of this long side of the triangle is A
and the other two sides of the triangle are B and C.
And this is a well-known relationship taught
to all people who take geometry in grade school.
But because this equation has a bunch of square terms,
Bill James called his winning percentage estimator, his look at Runs and Wins,
he called it his Pythagorean Theorem.
And he did this in 1980 in his 1980 abstract.
What he basically said was that the Runs a team scored
and the runs a team allowed relates to it's winning percentage.
This is exactly what we've been covering so far in this module.
And his formula is that the winning percentage
which, by definition, is your wins over your wins plus losses, the total games
played.
Your winning percentage, according to Bill James,
is approximated by the runs you score squared divided
by the sum of the runs you score plus the runs you allow,
both those terms squared.
So this is his Pythagorean Theorem, and it actually is pretty good.
So we're going to run through various winning percentage
estimators, that's what this is.
The Pythagorean Theorem, Bill James' Pythagorean Theorem,
this formula here is a winning percentage estimator,
it's trying to estimate a team's number of wins.
So if we know runs that we're going to score
and runs that we're going to allow, we can predict our winning percentage.
And if we know how many games we play, we
can actually predict how many wins you're
going to have that year based on knowing the winning percentage.
Let's review a snippet of sequel code that I'm
going to use to do our runs to wins analysis, continue on our Runs
to Wins analysis, but also estimate winning percentage.
So let's go through this sequel code, and we'll have the code in text form
that you can download and play with in the sequel sandbox.
What we're doing is selecting year IDT by D, runs scored, runs allowed.
And then we're calculating as before runs per game,
the run scored divided by the number of games played,
which is the total of wins plus losses, and then runs allowed per game.
In the table, we're going to put in wins and losses, just for completeness,
but then we're also going to calculate the winning percentage.
Which is the total wins over the total number of games.
Now, what we have here are six versions of winning percentage estimators.
The first one was done by Earnshaw Cook.
We're going to cover Earnshaw Cook in a future historical segment.
But his formula for estimating winning percentage
was 0.484 times runs scored divided by runs allowed.
A very simple formula.
Another formula by Arnie Soolman was this one here.
He did a linear regression based on these data here.
He took these data wins, losses, winning percentage,
runs and runs allowed, and ran a linear regression
to come up with this formula.
0.102 times runs per game, which is the right up here, runs per game,
minus the runs allowed term, which is 1.103 times runs allowed per game,
added to 0.505.
Now, the added to 0.505 term is a little off,
because we know 0.5 represents the team that
wins as much as it loses that has a 500 record.
And also represents the team that scores the same amount of runs
as they also allow.
But Arnie found that this equation that he determined
was a good way to estimate the winning percentage.
Another professor, Purdue Kross, came up with a conditional winning percentage
estimator.
So if your runs are greater than runs allowed, in other words
you had an offense better than your defense,
you took the formula runs divided by two times runs allowed.
This was the one side, if you had a good offense,
but if you had a poor offense where runs allowed were equal or greater
than the runs you scored, you would do one minus the runs
allowed divided by two times R.
Now, this formula by Kross is another winning percentage estimator.
And then David Smyth had his own winning percentage estimator
which was runs minus runs allowed divided by runs plus runs allowed.
Plus this term here makes more sense because you start here.
This is the 500 team with the same number of runs allowed
and runs gets you to 500 in an estimator for winning.
Finally, this is the Bill James formula which we just showed you before.
The Bill James formula was the winning percentage
is approximated by runs squared, this term here,
this is just a function which raises this term to this term.
Runs squared divided by the total of runs squared plus runs allowed squared.
So run squared plus runs allowed squared,
that's what the power function does.
And we're calling that in our table Bill James' Pythagorean winning percentage.
But then later on, other folks found that if you change this exponent
from squared, you moved it to another term and people like the term 1.83,
you actually improved upon Bill James' Pythagorean formula.
And different times and different places Bill James
himself has used this exponent in his Pythagorean winning percentage
estimator.
So we include that one, too.
So I ran this snippet of sequel code, and I'm
going to show you different ways to estimate some of the accuracy of each
of these winning percentage estimators.
So we took it from the team's database in the layman database.
I did it two ways.
The first way I did it was teams from 1901 to 2013.
I did the complete modern era in my query.
And then the second time, I did it from 1955 to 2013,
and that's greater than 1954.
That's this term here.
And the reason I chose 1955, this gets to an important question
which I'll just treat as an aside right here.
This is the modern era.
This is a reasonable thing to do when you want to look at all of baseball
and increase your sample size over many different team seasons.
I decided this was useful to do.
But in general, I like starting from 1955
for a lot of work in the layman database, especially.
Because this is where we find they record,
reliably, for all players and teams, some of the actual statistics
we need to calculate some of the favored formulas that we use in sabermetrics.
So in 1954, they started recording sacrifice flies,
and in 1955, they started finally keeping records of intentional walks.
These two terms are useful in various runs estimators
that we'll cover in the next module.
In general, whatever range of years you choose to do the study you want to do,
you just have to be able to defend your choice of years.
So I like 1955 forward, because now I can use sacrifice flies
and intentional walks as needed in the various formulas I might want
to use in the different studies trying to answer various questions I
have in sabermetrics and baseball analytics.
So I like 1955 forward, but remember to defend whatever choice you make,
and always explain the assumptions you make in your studies.
That's the end of the slide.
