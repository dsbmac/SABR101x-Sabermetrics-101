 
ANDY ANDRES: In the previous segment, we talked
about the importance of Henry Chadwick to sabermetrics
and described what's shown here, which is his score sheet, as published
in Chadwick's Base Ball Manual in 1874.
Now Chadwick published his score sheet because he
wanted players and fans and coaches to be able to record the game well,
to record the events of the game, to recreate them for other people to read.
Eventually leading to the box score.
Now this is the score sheet as recorded, as we talked about last time.
But eventually, you reduce these numbers into the box score, as shown here.
Now, Chadwick describes this as what you would publish in the paper.
You would take the information, going back to the score sheet.
You would take, for example, all the base hits recorded
by all the batsmen that are record in this column
and transfer them to the box score, which would be published in the papers.
You take information about all the defensive plays also made
by the players and transfer that to the box score.
So what you have here is the box score where, again, you
list the players on each ball club.
And you record the runs that they each had, the hits they each got,
their put outs, assists, and E for errors or muffs.
And in the line score down here, you would describe each of the runs
in each of the nine innings by each of the clubs.
And, of course, record the umpire, time of the game,
and different other details, like we'd see in a modern box score.
And I think it's fair to call him the inventor of what became the modern box
score.
But he wasn't the inventor of the original box score.
Now let's show you an example of one of Chadwick's box scores.
This is from a game in 1876 between the Boston Red
Stockings and the Philadelphia Athletic.
And, as before, what's listed here are each
of the players and their positions.
Now, there's a typo here on the Boston lineup.
Schafer, that season, always played third base.
So this must be just a typo in the newspaper.
 
From the previous slide, we saw what Chadwick always
recommended to put in the box score in the newspapers
to describe and recreate the game-- runs, hits, put-outs, assists,
and errors for each of the team.
And then times to the plate, times at bat.
What we have here is, again, the line score.
And the Red Stockings won 19-11, 19 to 11, that day
against the Philadelphia Athletic.
A couple interesting things about this box score, very interesting players.
One is George Wright.
George Wright, here, batted lead off for the Red Stockings and played shortstop.
Member of the Hall of Fame, Baseball Hall
of Fame, because he was such a good player.
But he also designed the first public golf course in the United States,
in Boston, and became a golf shop proprietor
for many years following his career as a baseball player.
Another Hall of Famer on this team was O'Rourke, another great batsman
and good first baseman.
So let's go back to the beginning and recall
what I have as a working definition of sabermetrics.
If sabermetrics is the science of baseball,
and science is all about observation, experimentation, objective knowledge
acquisition, then what we have here is Henry Chadwick,
a detailed observationist of the game of baseball.
Over a couple decades he watches very carefully
and starts recording lots of different events that are going on on the field.
And presenting them in a format that readers of newspapers
can recreate the game by just looking at this box score.
Remember what Chadwick said in 1856.
He watched the game with a deeper interest.
And he was struck by the idea that this could become the American game.
So he dedicated his life to this notion of advancing this game
and advancing the knowledge of this game and advancing the record of this game.
The great John Thorn has said this about Henry Chadwick.
"In the long romance of baseball and numbers,
no figure was more important than that of Henry Chadwick."
And it is true.
Baseball does have a romance with numbers.
And numbers love the game of baseball.
 
I believe that without Henry Chadwick the game of baseball today
would be very different.
There may not be any sabermetrics at all without his efforts.
He truly was the first sabermetrician, the first analyst,
the first careful scientific observer of the game.
And that's why we cover Henry Chadwick right away
at the beginning of Sabermetrics 101.
You need to have a greater appreciation of the contributions
of key figures, especially ones that aren't as well known
as modern-day sabermetricians.
