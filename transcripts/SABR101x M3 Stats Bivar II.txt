ANDY ANDRES: OK.
The last few things I want to talk about in bivariate analysis
are the equation of the best fit line and a couple other points
about what we can assume with these kinds of results
and how to approach these kind of bivariate analyses
whenever you're going to do them.
So here are a couple graphs we saw before.
What's been added here is the equation of the best fit
line for each of the graphs.
These graphs were runs per game and winning percentage.
The x-axis had runs per game, and this is an offensive measure
and runs against per game, which is a defensive measure.
And then the team's winning percentage.
So what these two equations say when you look at this equation of the line
is that there's an intercept.
And it's right around here for this graph, right around here
for this graph.
That's 0.2016.
But this term here that's multiplied by x we can think about here.
What this is saying is that, for every increase in x, from 4 to 5,
say, from 4 to 5, for that increase, we're
going to increase our winning percentage by 0.675.
So you increase your offense by one run per game
and you're going to increase your winning percentage by 0.675.
Now, the coefficient of determination is OK, not great.
When we calculate the correlation coefficient, turns out it equals 0.534.
That's r.
We do it for this coefficient of determination,
for the runs against graph.
And r equals 0.561.
Now, again, this term here represents what the difference in the y-axis
will be when you change 1 in the x-axis.
So, again, if I go from 4 to 5 runs against-- in other words, what it means
is my team is worse than teams with better runs against per game numbers.
Looking at the equation of the line is going
to help us better understand the association between these two
variables.
This is a graph we've seen before but we've included now
the coefficient of determination, 0.8962, and the equation of the line.
Now, the intercept of the y-axis is 0.5.
That's what this here is.
This is the y-intercept of 0.5.
So that's where that goes.
It's right here.
There's where that starts.
But for every change in run differential--
a 1 run change in run differential is going to lead to a 0.103 improvement
in winning percentage.
So I change run differential by 1, my winning percentage goes up 0.1.
In other words, a 500 team all of a sudden becomes a 600 team.
And this is represented by the graph here.
If you look at the line and you plot where 1 is, it's right at 600,
2 right at 700.
Which is this relationship.
You go 1 over on the x-axis and you improve y by 0.1.
And that's what we're showing here.
Again, a very high coefficient of determination, and you
would also have a higher correlation coefficient.
Now, I wanted to talk about this notion of cause and effect.
This is a graph looking at run differential and winning percentage.
We don't really know if run differential causes an improved winning percentage.
All we know is there is an association.
There's a relationship between run differential and winning percentage.
So we cannot assume that run differential causes winning percentage
or that winning percentage causes run differential.
Here's a silly example, but done in teaching quite often.
I'm going to put on the x-axis ice cream consumption, how much ice cream
people eat.

We're going to plot drowning.
And remember this is just an example.
But the amount of drowning occurring in any given city, for example.
So drowning rates and ice cream consumption.
When I get these data, it turns out there's
a positive correlation to these data.
In other words, ice cream consumption is high and drowning is high.
There's a positive correlation.
Ice cream consumption is low and you have a low drowning rate.
This association between ice cream consumption and drowning
may lead you to the conclusion that ice cream consumption causes drowning.
That's kind of ridiculous.
That's the point of the example about cause and effect.
There's another variable here causing the problem.
We call those confounders.
In other words, something else is going on here.
And that's actually seasons, the weather.

So if it's hot, people swim and they increase their risk of drowning.
If it's hot, they also increase their consumption of ice cream.
So if it's cold, both these things will go down.
So if it's hot, increased drowning risk because of increased swimming
and increased ice cream consumption.
If it's cold, you're going to decrease your ice cream consumption,
and, because people don't swim as much, they're going to decrease drowning.
So the weather is really the key confounder here.
Bottom line-- you cannot assume cause and effect with these scatter plots.
No cause and effect here.

Cannot do it.
Now, we can talk about associations.
Generally-- this is the general case-- if there's
an association in your scatter plot, a change in x may cause a change in y.
A change in y may cause a change in x or there
could be another variable here, a confounding variable, that
could both x and y to change.
And that's this case here.
This is the confounding variable causing both x and y to change,
but, in general, if we want to understand how things actually work,
this is where the scientist does an experiment.

Science includes experimentation, where you actually manipulate the situation,
control for different variables that might
lead to knowledge acquired about the cause and effect.
So if you need to get a mechanism of how things work,
it's beyond the scope of statistics, but experiments can get at the mechanism.
