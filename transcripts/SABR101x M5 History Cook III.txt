ANDY ANDRES: Certainly, compared to other works
of the time and other baseball books in general,
Cook's work is very math centric.
It had hundreds of equations in the book, and the hundreds of tables
included were so complex and hard to understand,
making the book very challenging for many readers.
Simplicity and clarity wasn't necessarily what Cook was aiming for.
It had a limited impact because of the math centric way it was presented,
so Cook didn't get as much recognition within the game of baseball
as he was looking for.
Now, George Lindsey, who we'll cover next week in Sabermetrics 101 history
track, wrote a review of the book and was very critical
of Percentage Baseball.
He talked about how it was a book that was nowhere near as
concise as a journal article.
He said the probability theory was filled with problems.
There was mistakes made in how he described his probability theory.
And in a field that was emerging as potentially an academic field,
he didn't give any acknowledgement to previous work done in the area.
Lindsey thought that there were plenty of places of hyperbole
where some colorful language was extending what really should
have been more conservatively described.
He did call it a pioneer book, a very important book,
and he actually was appreciative of the lively and amusing style in places,
but I think he was using code words there
to say that it really wasn't written in an academic way.
Bottom line, Lindsey was very critical of Percentage Baseball
in one of the reviews he wrote.
Because of the criticism he's received, and because this book isn't widely
read compared to some other works by early sabermetricians,
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Earnshaw Cook will not likely
be a charter member of the Sabermetrics Hall of Fame,
but his slide rule to use in the calculations
for the book is included in the Hall of Fame.
Side note here, the Sabermetrics Hall of Fame is not a real thing.
It's just this fictional thing I'm using to represent very important people
in the history of Sabermetrics.
You've got to give Cook credit for a very important thing.
He was applying a scientific approach to the game,
and he was using the analytics he was familiar with to better understand
the game.
And he really was a pioneer, and he did do it over 50 years ago.
He published this book because he believed
it had something to offer to the game and to people who liked the game.
Here's a quote from his introduction.
"About the book," he says, "if it can eventually influence other aficionados
to undertake the more comprehensive, more precise, and more extensive
researches which the game deserves as an American institution and a challenge
to ingenuity, I shall be content."
In other words, he's happy to write this book to inspire future sabermetricians,
and there's no doubt he did.
There's no doubt that a group of sabermetricians
we will talk about for years to come were
influenced by Earnshaw Cook's thinking.
And for that, he deserves his time here in Sabermetrics 101
as an important sabermetrician.
Here are a few references that should be read by all students.
The first is this URL here.
Alan Schawrz on ESPN.com writes a very nice summary of Cook in his work.
Frank Deford in 1964 wrote a very extensive article
on Earnshaw Cook and his work and published it in March 1964
just before the release of his book more broadly and published by Waverly Press.
Interesting side note, Frank Deford's brother
was good friends with Earnshaw Cook's nephew,
and this is the reason Deford actually heard about Cook
and convinced the Sports Illustrated editors
to write an extensive piece on Earnshaw Cook and his ideas.
Eight years later, Frank Deford followed up
before the release of Earnshaw Cook's second book,
and he wrote another article that you probably
would be wise to read to better understand
Earnshaw Cook and his contributions to Sabermetrics.
