 
ANDY ANDRES: Welcome to the track we're calling the History of Sabermetrics.
And in this first segment, I want to talk about one of the key figures
in sabermetrics history, which is Henry Chadwick.
Now, this is a page from the book written by Henry Chadwick called
How to Play Baseball, and so I scanned this page from a digital copy online.
So there's Henry Chadwick, and he's widely
known as the "Father of Baseball," and you
can see that here on the book that he himself wrote.
So at the time, he was known as the "Father of Baseball."
Henry Chadwick was a writer.
And Henry Chadwick was a pioneer, certainly in scorekeeping,
keeping the record of the games of baseball that he observed.
But he also was very crucial in keeping the rules straight, keeping
the rules recorded and refined for the game of baseball.
He really was a champion of the game.
In the early part of his career, though, Chadwick
was a writer for the New York newspapers about cricket, the game of cricket,
and he was a fan and a player.
And that was his background.
He came from England, moved here when his father moved here
when he was 13 years old and moved to Brooklyn,
and continued his fascination with the game of cricket
when he became a writer later in his career.
But then in 1856, everything changed.
He started noticing more people playing the game of baseball.
And that led to his lifelong fascination with the game.
It led to the title that he sort of received as the "Father of Baseball."
Now, he was so prominent and important to the game
that he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1938.
And the plaque reads in the Hall of Fame,
"Baseball's preeminent pioneer writer for half a century.
Inventor of the box score.
Author of the first rule book in 1858.
Chairman of the Rules Committee in the first nation-wide baseball
organization."
So those are his key contributions.
A pioneer writer-- he was one of the original writers, not the first one,
but one of the first.
They say here that he was the "inventor of the box score."
And that's fairly controversial, and we'll
talk about that soon in the next slide.
But his pioneering efforts were in the rules and in popularizing the game,
writing about the game.
That was crucial.
He also, as you'll see, was a record-keeper, a scorekeeper.
Because he came from cricket, and as a fan of cricket
he was a key record-keeper there, he decided
to keep the record of the baseball games just as well.
 
So here is actually the first box score ever published.
The first box score ever published here was in 1845,
and that was published in the New York Herald on October 25th.
This game, this baseball game between the Brooklyn Ball Club and the New York
Ball Club, took place on October 24th.
But notice the date.
This is before Chadwick takes an interest in the game of baseball.
What they record in this really crude box score are Hands Out.
Now, Hands Out here, for each of the players on each of the teams,
the Hands Out records the outs made by each of these players.
So if they were put out as they batted the ball, or they were struck out,
or they were tagged out on the base paths as a runner,
it was recorded here in the Hands Out column.
Otherwise, they scored a run.
So they just recorded the two crucial things
that were components of the game, the runs each of the players scored,
and they were totaled here, for each of the teams.
Now, as we know, that's the outcome of the game.
So the New York Ball Club wins this game 37 runs to 19 runs.
So that's what this original box score recorded.
They didn't do a lot more recording of other information.
And Chadwick himself would have been familiar with these box scores.
Reporting on cricket, he would have noticed that the newspapers also
reported in this fashion, in this kind of box score fashion,
on the game of baseball.
But then, again, remember, 1856 is a key moment.
That's when he starts to watch the game and pay attention
to the game of baseball.
Chadwick turns from cricket towards baseball in 1856.
And he describes it as being a seminal moment in his career.
A direct quote from him was that, "The game
was being sharply played on both sides."
And he watched it with a, quote, "deeper interest"
than any previous baseball match he had seen.
And one of the key facets, one of the key things he realized
was that this game might become the "American game."
And just like cricket was the game of England,
he thought the game of baseball could become the American game.
Now, I think it's hard to overstate the importance of Chadwick's shift
in his career towards baseball, the importance of this moment in 1856.
He really does change the arc of the game
through his efforts over the next four or five
decades, where he really promotes the game and writes about it
and refines the rules.
But let's talk about his scorekeeping efforts.
Before we shift to the next slide, I want
to point out that there are two interesting things about this box
score itself.
Maybe this could be part of the discussion board--
who can figure out some interesting facts here about this box score?
But let's talk about the scorekeeping efforts of Henry Chadwick.
 
This is his original scoresheet that he settled on here,
and he publishes this scoresheet in a book
he wrote called Chadwick's Base Ball Manual.
He published this in 1874 after attending
a conference in Boston, where he describes more thoroughly to fans
of the game different ways to keep the record,
different ways to score the game.
So let's go through this scoresheet pretty quickly.
This is one side of his scoresheet.
Just like modern scoresheets, there's two sides
based on which team is on offense and which team is on defense.
And on this side of the scoresheet, we record
what happens to the offensive team.
It was the offensive batsman in their lineup order here.
This section is where you actually record
the events of each at-bat of all the offensive players.
So batsman 1 would come up in the first inning,
and we'd record the outcome of that at-bat here.
You'd also list, though, the defense on this scoresheet.
So let's review what all these columns mean here.
The Good Plays in Field-- what essentially you're
recording in each of these columns are the different kinds
of outs made by each of the defensive fielders.
So the first column here is Position.
So you'd list here second base, shortstop, third base
for each of the fielders, what position they play.
The second column is what Chadwick calls out on base.
And essentially, this is when you would make a put-out as a fielder.
So a fielder would make a put-out, and you
could imagine that even back then, the first baseman would
have a lot of put-outs and a lot of marks in this column.
So this is the put-outs column.
What was recorded separately, though-- but these were infielders, OK?
So this is like first, second, third, shortstop, outs on base in the infield.
What we have in this column is fair fly outs.
So these would be outs caught in the air by all the different fielders,
so fair fly outs.
And that's distinguished from foul fly outs in column L.
What's different here that we don't see anymore--
the rules changed about a decade later-- in column D,
you would mark outs made by foul bounds.
And bound is essentially a grounder, and a grounder
is defined as being a ball hit into the area of the infield.
So if a grounder, a ball hit sort of on the infield, was a foul ball
was fielded by the fielder, that would have been an out.
That would have been called a foul bound out.
K is the familiar strikeout of today.
It was used even back then.
So you record mostly strikeouts here, and this would be mostly
the catcher, whatever fielder it was.
But it they switched around, another player would get credit for that.
And R is a tag-out, a put-out by tagging.
So this is sort of the base runner being put out.
T is the total.
So this mark here would be the sum total of all these data
points here for each game.
And this is the familiar assist column, and Chadwick called it assistance.
So any time a fielder would make assistance
on another player's good play in field, their out recorded,
they'd get marked here.
And then there'd be the sum total at the bottom here.
On the field, in the game, you'd record all the different good plays in field
by the fielders.
Now, on this side over here of the scoresheet,
you'd record the information of each of the batsmen, the offensive information
of each of the batsmen.
And going in the opposite direction, here's the key one.
This is runs scored.
This is the number of runs scored.
This is not RBI's.
This is runs scored by each of the batsmen.
And coming from cricket scorekeeping, that's the key data point from cricket
and the key data point recorded in the earliest forms of box scores
and scorekeeping in baseball itself.
These are the number of outs made.
These two columns are remnants of the early crude box scores.
These are all outs made by each of the batsmen.
But this starts recording the hits.
These are all hits.
This is total hits.
This is the total bases.
So for a single double triple home run, they'd be weighted 1,
2, 3, and 4 just like total bases are today.
So you'd mark here-- you'd mark in each of these,
you would put little dots here.
Four dots would register a home run when you did the scorekeeping.
OK?
And then you'd just mark 1 here for a base
hit if this batsman here hit a home run.
Now, this is reaching base on error, and this is M for Muffs.
They called them muffs back in the day, not errors.
So if they reached base, if the batsman reached base on a muff from a fielder,
they'd get marked here.
 
And the next one here, the next column here is reaching base on a walk.
Interesting, as we consider the value of walks today by batsmen.
It was actually considered a base on error back then.
In other words, a mistake by the pitcher to allow the batter, the batsman,
to get on base on balls by a walk.
Now, finally, if the batsman was left on base as a runner, it was marked here.
So this is a thing recorded still today.
How many batsmen were left on base?
And finally, this is the interesting column.
This is not often happening in this time, but this is the home run column.
Any time a home run was hit, it would be marked here.
You'd mark a home run here.
And these home runs were defined as strong hits,
not muffed, past the outfielders, the people not in the infield.
So this is really recording big home runs.
And this is what Chadwick set up, and this
is what Chadwick taught people on how to score the game.
So this is the original sort of Chadwick scoresheet
that started record-keeping through the 19th century baseball.
Since this segment's getting a little long
and we have more to talk about with Henry Chadwick,
I thought I'd break it up here.
So please do the assessment following this video,
and then move on to the Part 2 of Henry Chadwick and the History
of Sabermetrics..
