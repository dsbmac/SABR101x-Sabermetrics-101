 
ANDY ANDRES: So let's talk about Hugh Fullerton, sabermetrician.
Hugh Fullerton, sabermetrician here.
And this article that we're going to cover first was written in August 1906.
Now, August 1906 precedes his work in October 1906
where he does that careful analysis of two teams going against one another
and determining which team would win a short series like the World Series.
So before he even does his forecasting work that actually distinguishes him
in the baseball writers world of the day,
he publishes this small article in the Washington Evening Star
called the "Chances of Things Happening in Baseball Games."
Now, a direct quote from this article is "But what
the chances are of certain play being pulled off successfully, few know.
I wanted to find out."
So he lays out the case that he's going to do play by play analysis here.
Play by play analysis really wasn't done much before this article,
before Fullerton starts this work.
So Fullerton saw many games as a sports writer
and he kept score sheets, scorecards, of the plays of the game.
So what we're seeing here is Fullerton using his observational skills.
He was a keen observer of the game watching many baseball games,
and he let his natural curiosity take over
as he started to ask questions about the game.
Now, he had data in his score sheets.
Using that data, he tried to find out more information about the game itself.
He was trying to better understand some of the basic probabilities of the game.
Some of the basics.
When I say basics, I mean how many runners
get to first, second, third, and actually score, get to home and score
a run for the team.
So some of the basic questions like that.
And then how many times does the runner score from second base on a single,
and how many times is he thrown out at home plate.
So just basic questions like that he starts to ask.
But then he does a lot of analysis beyond that at sacrifices.
He looks at sacrifice bunts and hits to try
to better understand the value of that play.
He looks at stolen bases and analyzes how stolen bases work in the game.
He also looks at squeeze plays, the specific
plays when you bunt to try to get the runner home from third.
And then he analyzes a common play of the day called the slashing play.
 
But he's answering some basic questions about the game with the data
he collected in his score sheet by analyzing, again, play by play data.
Play by play data is what he's using from his score sheets to help
understand these particular plays- sacrifices,
stolen bases, squeeze plays, et cetera.
So let's look at some of the data that Fullerton covers in this article.
He had score sheets and play by play data from 158 games.
And in those 158 games, he analyzed over 12,000
at bats with over 2,500 hits, 929 walks, 62 hit
by pitches, resulting in a 209 batting average, which
should tell you something about the era of the game.
This was the Dead Ball era.
And all in all, he had a 7% walk rate from these 929 bases on balls.
So after Fullerton describes his basic play by play data results, the basics,
he turns his attention to sacrifice bunts.
And he counted 911 situations in those 158 games
where a sacrifice bunt was attempted.
And out of those 911, 582 were successful.
And successful meant different things.
Sometimes there was a throwing error by the defense.
Sometimes the batter actually got a hit.
And the other times it was just successful
because they move the runner from first base to second base.
Now, interestingly, he says that 81 times it helped win games.
In other words, that attempted sacrifice turned the tide of the game
or won the game.
That's an awful lot.
If you think about it, he's only looking at 158 games.
So half the games, essentially, are influenced directly
in terms of winning or influencing the game with sacrifice bunts.
I think with this goes to show is the importance of this play in the Dead
Ball era.
Now, he goes on to say this was a discouraging result, because it
actually wasn't that successful.
Before he actually ran the numbers, he thought
this play was actually more successful than it turned out to be.
He goes on to mention that 92 times out of the 911 situations,
the defense actually got the advancing runner at second base.
Just part of those discouraging results.
Now, moving on, he talks about the hit and run play.
And he calls that "slashing into the ball."
It was a common play of the day that the batter would actually
try to slash into the ball and drive a grounder through the infield.
That's what he meant by slashing into the ball in a hit and run play,
as another way to advance the runner a base as a sacrifice play.
And this was very discouraging.
This play didn't work well at all.
The success rate of slashing was about 59%,
where the success rate of the sacrifice bunt was about 64%.
So the sacrifice bunt success rate was about 64%.
So 64% here.
The slashing play was only successful 58% of the time.
But the big problem with the slashing play is when you made the mistake
and it didn't work, you've got a GIDP.
You basically got a double play.
A ground ball into a double play.
And that was-- that's always an inning killer.
Anyone who plays or watches the game knows the value
of a double play if you're on the defense
or how it crushes an offensive attempt from the batting side.
So one of the big results of this simple analysis by Fullerton
is a real discouragement around the art of the sacrifice bunt,
or the art of slashing into the ball to actually advance the runner one base.
The next play he analyzes is the stolen base.
And he notes that stealing third base is actually more successful than attempts
at stealing second base.
The percentage success rate was actually much better when trying for third.
Now, these numbers are numbers that are lower than current sabermetric thinking
likes to see, but that was the era.
That was the time when there were more stolen base attempts.
It was a bigger part of the game.
The next thing he looks at are the squeeze plays.
And the squeeze plays, if you're not familiar with them,
are when the batter tries to bunt the runner home from third base.
11 times out of 16 in the 158 games analyzed, the squeeze play
was successful.
And of the five times it didn't work, four
were because the batter missed the ball and the runner
was actually tagged out because of the missed bunt.
The next thing that Fullerton looks at is
very similar to a current sabermetrics principle
called run scoring probabilities.
And Fullerton attempts to measure run scoring chances, he calls them,
run scoring chances-- which is very similar to run
scoring probability-- of scoring after starting on first base.
So if you get to first base by a hit, hit by pitch, reach on error,
walk, fielder's choice, any way you get on first base
as a runner, what are your probability of actually
scoring a run once you get there?
Well, it turned out in that era at that time, and with Fullerton's data,
you've got a 25% chance of scoring.
He had over 3,900 runners at first in his data set,
and 974 runs were scored out of those 3,900 runners at first.
He also analyzed runners at third base and looked
at the probability of scoring with either two outs, one out, or no outs.
And so these are the probabilities he came up with.
So a real early attempt at situational run scoring probabilities.
This is just a brief introduction to some very early play
by play analytics done by Hugh Fullerton.
So going back to our definition of sabermetrics,
there's no doubt Hugh Fullerton was an early sabermetrician.
Close observer of the game, letting his natural curiosity
take over to ask some questions about the game.
And he certainly had the data set to help answer his questions.
