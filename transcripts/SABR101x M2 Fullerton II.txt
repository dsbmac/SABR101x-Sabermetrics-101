 
ANDY ANDRES: I want to add a short little video here talking
about another interesting article that Hugh Fullerton wrote about forecasting.
 
In the New York Evening World in 1920-- early 1920--
he wrote about the purchase of Babe Ruth by the Yankees from the Red Sox.
And as a forecaster, what Fullerton did was
predict eight or nine more wins for the Yankees
because of Babe Ruth and his slugging bat.
He also predicted that there would be losses because of his defense
being not as good as the defender that you might
be able to put in right field for the New York Yankees.
Now this little blurb here actually gets it wrong.
 
Fullerton does not say Ruth will lose as many games
as he wins for his lack of base running and fielding skill.
He actually doesn't say that in the article,
but he does mention that there will be a negative impact on the Yankees because
of his defense and his base running.
The other interesting part of this article
is that he says something very similar to what
Michael Lewis argues in the book Moneyball.
The quote here is "rich clubs have all the advantage.
If money can purchase a championship, then the interest in baseball is dead."
Another little example of Hugh Fullerton, the forecaster.
So let's move on to Hugh Fullerton the writer.
 
Now, one of the most-- one of the things Hugh Fullerton is most well-known for
is his work on the Black Sox Scandal of 1919, a great baseball scandal.
And in this article that you can read, Fullerton
talks about the information he was gathering during the World Series that
led him to question the legitimacy of the actions of some of the players
on the White Sox.
This has led to wonderful books and movies about the Black Sox scandal.
And Fullerton was a very important piece of the scandal,
and mainly because he was widely known since 1906 to be a great analyst,
a good forecaster-- somebody who was good with numbers to look at which team
might be better than another one, especially
during a series of games against a team, like the World Series.
So as an analyst, Fullerton thought something
was fishy with the way the White Sox were playing.
And he started hearing more from gamblers and other folks
around the teams that the White Sox weren't giving their full effort.
One of my favorite vignettes that's covered in this article
is with this catcher, Ray Schalk.
Now Ray Schalk was not part of the scandal,
he never was indicted or accused of anything.
And what Ray Schalk talks about directly to Hugh Fullerton
is how Eddie Cicotte, the starting pitcher,
would cross him up during games, especially key pivotal moments.
The catcher would be calling for a curve ball or a shine ball,
and Cicotte would just throw a straight ball, a fastball.
And so getting crossed up like that was something
that had never happened all year between these two players, the pitcher
and the catcher, but it started during the World Series.
Fullerton goes on to describe the conversation with Schalk, the catcher,
with other players on the team where Schalk's
confronting them about what he knows.
So there's a lot of evidence here building up and Fullerton, essentially
being the writer analyst that he is, the budding sabermetrician that he is,
reports it in the Chicago papers.
And he gets criticized by some of the media for doing that.
Bottom line, Fullerton's a very important part
of the Black Sox Scandal of 1919, being the beat writer of the White Sox
at the time.
And his use of statistics, his analytical side,
was crucial in his conclusion that the White Sox actually
were throwing the World Series.
