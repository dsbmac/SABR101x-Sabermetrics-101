ANDY ANDRES: For the history track in this module,
we're going to be talking about Hugh Fullerton, a writer, forecaster,
scientist, and sabermetrician.
Hugh Fullerton was born in 1873 in Ohio and was a good enough baseball
player to play for the Ohio State Buckeyes,
and then some semi-pro baseball after he graduated.
But he starts out as a writer in Chicago right after he finishes college,
and he becomes a very influential writer through his career
and a big supporter of the game of baseball.
We're going to talk about his impact on baseball as a writer,
as a forecaster, the scientific work he did, and then the sabermetrics
he also did.
"Hugh Fullerton, in 20 years, has scored and studied 3,500 professional baseball
games.
He is unequaled in his enthusiasm, intelligence, and authority
on the subject of baseball."
Now, I claim Hugh Fullerton is less widely
known compared to, say, Alan Roth, Henry Chadwick, Earnshaw
Cook, and other older sabermetricians.
So how does Fullerton distinguish himself
relative to all the other writers that were out there writing at the time?
One thing that he gets credited for is using
direct quotes of players and managers in his articles.
That, in and of itself, wouldn't put Fullerton
into the pantheon of early sabermetricians
and major influences on the development of the game of baseball.
What Fullerton essentially was was an observer.
He studied many, many games.
He wrote about those games, and he recorded those games.
Just like Chadwick was an observer and a recorder, so was Fullerton.
Fullerton was also an analyst, though, and he
tried to analyze his observation to create models and hypotheses about how
the game worked.
And that's what we're going to cover in this segment.
So what does the analytically-inclined writer
do when the World Series is coming to Chicago in 1906?
Well, Fullerton analyzed that World Series, and it's an interesting story.
It's really the beginning of his analytical career.
Before the Series started, he wrote an article for his newspaper
predicting a White Sox win in the World Series.
And this was against all other forecasters.
 
Now, the interesting part of the story here
is that when he wrote this analysis, he'd picked the White Sox.
And a man in authority, his editor, refused
to take a chance in printing such a ridiculous analysis.
But it turned out to be exactly right.
His analysis was spot on.
He picked the White Sox in six games.
On October 15, after the World Series was over,
The Tribune came back and published his full article as is.
They put this different headline at the front,
where they admitted their mistake of not printing it earlier.
What were the analytics that Fullerton did in this article?
What were the kind of information he used to build his forecast,
to predict the White Sox win in the World Series?
In this article, which you can read after this video,
he talks about his system of doping.
"Doping" is a term used back then about prediction or forecasting.
He looked at the players on both teams, the White Sox and the Cubs,
and first he looked at their player statistics.
If you looked at the statistics straight up,
it looked very clear the Cubs were probably the better team.
But as an analyst, Fullerton looked further, beyond the player stats.
What he decided to look at was the "condition of body and nerve."
He would go in the clubhouse and talk to the players, and the managers,
and the clubhouse boys to get a sense of the makeup of the players.
Were they of the right nerve to perform well
under pressure, the pressure of the World Series?
Were they healthy enough to perform under the World Series?
So he got extra information about the psychology of the players
and added that into his little model, his little system,
of doping and predicting which team was going to win.
Now, the leagues were separate back then.
There was no inter-league play.
They only played in the World Series, the leagues played each other.
So what Fullerton did, being familiar with the National and the American
League, he started clustering the opposing pitcher types.
 
What he would do is look at the Cub's pitchers,
cluster them together with American League pitchers
that the White Sox batters had already seen, and look at performance
splits against those kinds of pitchers.
So he's doing early clustering analysis and using
what we would call splits data, seeing how
batters performed against certain types of pitchers,
to help forecast who would be the better team.
He also was, very importantly, looking at park effects.
How were the parks different and how would that
impact the performance of different players?
He had such good record-keeping, he knew the tendencies of hitters,
if they were pull hitters or not.
He had charts and records of where all these hitters hit.
So looking at the stats, trying to get a sense of their psychology and readiness
to perform at a high level in a high-pressure situation,
getting better predictions about how certain batters might
do against certain kinds of pitchers, and looking at park effects,
mixing that all together for every player,
he predicted the White Sox would be the champions in six games.
And he was exactly correct.
Again, this was not a popular view at the time.
Fullerton gained a lot of notoriety with his forecast,
with his doping system at that point, and he
would do it every year subsequent to that.
He would do all these kinds of analyses listed here
for World Series play to predict World Series champions,
and he would do that throughout his career as a writer in Chicago.
