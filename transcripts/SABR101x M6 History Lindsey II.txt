 
ANDY ANDRES: Reviewing what we covered in the first paper by Lindsey,
he basically concludes that batting average
is a poor measure of the true talent of a hitter.
But he does find some interesting situational differences.
A secondary question of his paper was demonstrating these left handed,
right handed batting splits against other pitchers.
And here's the data he shows.
Previously we described the batting average of same handed hitting.
That's right here.
Same handed hitting is at 231.
In other words, right handed batters face right handed pitchers.
And left handed batters face left handed pitchers.
So he calls this situation the same handedness.
And he's got over 6,000 at bats to look at in his data set.
And when you have the same handedness situation, batting average is 231.
When it's the opposite, in other words, left handed batters face
right handed pitchers and right handed batter face left handed pitchers,
the batting average turns out to be 263.
And he did the statistics looking at the differences in these two samples.
And showed that the difference is real.
And the p value was less than 0.001.
Which means it's highly significant.
Those are the data he collects in situations.
And as far as I can tell, this is the first published demonstration
of these splits.
Left handed, right handed splits.
I think it was commonly known.
I think it was described by other folks.
But this is the first published statistical test of it.
 
One interesting thing is that when you analyze the at bats,
59 percent of the plate appearances, the at bats, were by right handed batters.
41 percent of the at bats were left handed batters.
But on the pitching side, 73 percent of the at bats
were thrown by right handed pitchers.
27 by left handed pitchers.
So it's almost three quarters right handed pitchers.
One quarter left handed pitchers.
And it's 60-40 right handed batters, left handed batters.
Now, looking at the batting average of the different batters,
left handed batters versus right handed batters, Lindsey reports a difference.
Left handed batters have a higher batting average, 256.
Versus the right handed batters, 241.
This is just looking at the batters here.
Taking all left handed batters and combining them
into getting a batting average.
And all the right handed batters here and here,
to get the right handed batting average.
Interestingly, there's an error in the paper.
I redid the calculations and it was 256 for lefties batting.
And 241 for right handers batting.
What Lindsey reports in his paper is that lefties batted 258.
And righties batted 240.
That was an error in the paper that the reviewers didn't catch.
But I recalculated based on these numbers.
I'll leave it for the student as an exercise
to recalculate the left handed batters' batting average from these two rows.
Where batter has L on it.
And then the right handed batter batting average as well.
Now why could this be?
What Lindsey speculates is that there's a high percentage of right
handed pitchers here.
There's a high percentage of right handed pitchers.
73 percent of pitches are thrown by right handed pitchers.
73 percent of at bats are thrown by right handed pitchers.
And because of this difference, because of the known opposite handedness splits
difference, lefties actually bat better than righties
because lefties actually will perform better against right handed pitchers.
And there's three to one more right handed pitchers.
Now Lindsey doesn't test this.
But he speculates that this result of lefties batting better than righties
is because of the high number right handed pitchers.
 
Another question addressed by this paper,
was looking at run expectancy in one very specific situation,
George collects data.
Lindsey collects data looking at the bases loaded situations.
And here's what he collects.
Here are-- remember what this is.
This is bases full.
So bases are full here.
This is the only situation he looks at in the 1959 paper.
Now how many runs are scored after the bases are full?
And he does it in the three situations.
No outs, one out, and two outs.
So when the bases are full and there's nobody out,
there are 13 chances in his data set where there's no runs scored.
Zero runs are scored.
23 chances where there is one run scored.
And the expected, out of all of these here,
the expected runs scored in that situation is 2.3 runs.
On average, when you average this all out, it's 2.3 runs.
When you're in the situation of bases full and nobody out,
the average numbers of runs scored is 2.3.
With one out, the average expected runs is 1.6 runs.
And when you have bases loaded and two outs, the average expected runs is 0.9.
What he does is graph the times a team scores
10 runs after the bases are full.
That happened twice.
Once after no outs.
And once after one out.
 
These are the data he puts together.
Now he also represents the same data graphically.
Here is the distribution of runs scored after the bases are full.
After bases are full, this is the situation
Lindsey's looking at in the '59 paper.
This is the no out situation.
One out, and the two out situation graphed here.
These lines are the expected.
This is 2.3 runs, which is the expected number of runs
when bases are loaded with nobody out.
This is 1.6 runs.
And this is 0.9 runs.
What you have here are the percentages of no runs scored.
One runs scored, that's right here.
Two runs scored, three, four, five, six, and then the rest.
You can see that zero, one, and two, three, four,
five are higher in the no out situation.
You've got more area and more right shift here
of run scoring when you start with the bases loaded and nobody out.
This makes sense.
Lindsey actually starts looking at run expectancy.
How many runs you're expected to score after you have the bases full.
And this is really a first look at run expectancy published in any papers
that I could find.
Lindsey got these data from 1952, 1956, '57 and '58.
And these are observations whenever the bases were full,
they would count how many runs were scored based on that situation.
I think this is the first published look at run expectancy.
And it's the first data analysis of situational probabilities.
He looks at this question, should you play
for one out versus trying for the double play?
By playing for one out, he's talking about getting the runner at home
in a force out.
And that means playing the infield in.
All the infielders would play in.
And if they got a grounder they would throw home.
Versus backing up the second baseman and the shortstop
and looking for a double play, to get two outs.
He's looking at each of these cases to determine
which is the better situational choice for the manager.
Now his data was incomplete.
He only had the bases loaded.
So he had to speculate about the other base out situations.
And what might be happening there if there ended up
being men on second and third, and how that
would look for run scoring in the future.
But this idea of looking at situations led to his very important 1963 paper.
We'll talk about that in an additional video.
But this first look at situations, and trying to analyze them,
is a hint at what's to come in the 1963 paper.
