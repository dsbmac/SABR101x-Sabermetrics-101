 
ANDY ANDRES: So continuing our look at run
scoring through the different eras of baseball, let's
cover a little history of the foundation of the Major Leagues.
Remember we started collecting data in professional baseball in 1871.
Well, as we know from Chadwick, our understanding of Chadwick and his work,
there was baseball being played at a very high level before that.
1871 is the establishment of the National Association
of Professional Baseball Players.
And that lasts for a few years, about five years,
before a new league forms after that one folds, which is the National League.
That's the National League that we know today.
It's been in continuous operation for a long, long time
as you see from this graph.
Other leagues are also on this graph here.
We can see there is the one-year Union Association in here.
Also included are the American Association teams.
This is the American Association around the same time.
There's also the one year of the Players League.
Now remember this is the time of the evolution of the game.
And part of the evolution of the game is settling down,
in terms of which leagues are going to last,
and how they're going to structure this to be a professional enterprise--an
enterprise of paying players to play, and where owners can actually create
a business side of this.
But we start talking mostly about the modern era.
But before we move on to looking at the run
scoring environments in the modern era, and how the leagues might be different,
let's just look at these data here, OK, these data here.
Do we see much difference potentially between run scoring environments
in any of the leagues?
Is there a league difference in run scoring environment?
And we look at these data and potentially this might be a difference.
Maybe there's a difference here with the Players League.
It might be different than the other leagues in that era, that actual year.
But it's hard to tell.
And again, if you're interested in this, seeing this difference,
you might explore it.
What could be the potential cause for this difference?
Do you think it actually is a significant difference or not?
So that's what a data analyst might do.
They observe the data and ask questions, if they're curious about it.
But let's focus now on the modern era to see
if we can find any differences between the leagues.
So here is the, here's the data from 1901 on.
This is just the modern era and we're graphing each league.
OK, now we've got a third league here, this is the Federal League.
The Federal League lasted for two years, and probably
the most interesting thing about the Federal League
is it gave us Wrigley Field where the Cubs play.
The Chicago team in the Federal League and the Chicago team in the National
League merged after the folding of the Federal League,
and they took over Wrigley Field.
So anyway let's just look at these data again
to see if we see much difference between the leagues.
So interestingly there is something to note here.
There is this funny bump-up in run scoring
from sort of the high threes, that's pretty consistent for awhile.
Then all of a sudden things bump up.
And this is actually well-described.
What happened here was the new ball.
There was a new ball in effect that was much more lively.
They had a new cork center, and they had different yarn in the ball,
and that increased run scoring.
You actually could hit the ball a little further.
It wasn't as soft or mushy as the previous balls were.
So it would actually go farther, you had a little more power,
and a little more run scoring.
But remember the rules changed in 1920 concerning pitching.
This was the time of spit balls and one of the things
that's described in this decrease of runs that is occurring here,
this decrease in runs that occurs here in this time frame from 1912,
1913 on downward was because of something called the emery ball.
The emery ball.
And the emery ball was essentially scuffing the ball.
What a pitcher found was if he scuffed the ball on concrete
and created a little rough side to it, the ball would actually move more.
So you get more movement on your pitches with scuffing the ball.
Very interesting question, in and of itself, the physics of that.
But the discovery of this was made clear that you reduced, again,
the run scoring environments.
The ball stayed the same, but pitchers readjusted
by adding more trick pitches.
Of course, 1920, they outlawed one of the trick pitches
and they grandfathered the spitballers to actually continue
to throw the spitball.
All very interesting, history of the game, that
explains the run scoring environment that we see here.
Observing the data some more, though, we're
looking for differences between the leagues, this is a big difference.
The American League actually has a much higher run scoring environment
than the National League.
This might be style of play.
It might be some effect just of smaller parks in the American League.
Certainly the House that Ruth Built starting in 1923--Yankee
Stadium--increased home runs for left-handed hitters.
But this is a question that people might want to explore.
What exactly are the potential causes of this difference between the American
League and the National League in their run scoring environments?
And again, students here can explore that on the forums or other places.
But this is an interesting difference between the leagues.
What happens with the designated hitter is this.
Remember the designated hitter starts in 1973.
And if you look at the data between the leagues, it's pretty consistent.
There is not much league difference until we get to 1979.
1979 we seem to create a split between the run scoring
environment of the American League, this is the AL here.
And this is the National League.
So finally you get this split here that's a potential difference.
It may be significant at this point, but the trend seems to continue--not
completely all the time, but there seems to be a significant separation between
the American League run scoring environment and the National League run
scoring environment.
Again understood, because we understand the new rules of the DH
and how it increases run scoring in the American League.
But again let's put our analyst hat on.
Let's observe these data carefully and just let our natural curiosity
take over to ask certain questions.
For example, we might ask why did it take until 1979?
Why 1979?
Why did we finally see the separation between run scoring environments
between the two leagues?
Designated hitter is a great explanation for this separation, but how come
it took many years for that to occur?
What's the explanation for the data staying the same for a good six years
until we get the separation in 1979?
This could be a question that you want to explore or think about.
But this is how a Sabermetrician thinks.
They observe data and they let their natural curiosity take over.
