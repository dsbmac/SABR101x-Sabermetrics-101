ANDY ANDRES: In this week's Sabermetrics track,
we're going to cover a very important part of baseball analytics.
Baseball analysts need to understand the different eras of the game.
Now this is not E-R-A, as in earned run average, this is the time frame eras.
And there have been different eras in the game of baseball.
So let's look at these data and try to think about the different time
frames, the different eras of baseball.
Let's explain the graph.
On the x-axis are all the different years of data
we've collected, starting in 1871 and going through 2010.
On the y-axis are runs per game.
These are the average runs per game from all the teams playing
professional baseball during that year.
And this gets us a sense of the run scoring environment.
Whether it's a time when runs are plentiful
and teams score a lot of runs, or maybe a time where they don't score
as many runs.
So let's look at these data, see if we see patterns.
See if we see anything interesting and, like analysts,
let's just let our natural curiosity take over and ask some questions.
First thing we notice is that there's probably
a difference here in a line right around the turn of the century.
There's a relative stability here, certainly compared
to the 19th century run scoring environment.
Now there's lots of changes post 1901, but generally, they're
more stable than the data we see here.
So 1871 is where we start collecting data on professional baseball
and that turns out to be the highest run scoring environment.
So averaging the runs per game for all the teams playing in 1871
gives us over 10 runs per game on average for those teams.
Now there could be sample size issues driving the stability here.
There were more teams playing baseball during this era.
Or it could be something fundamental to the game.
And that's what we're going to try to analyze, better understand,
some fundamental changes that have occurred over time.
Now, let's look at this.
I've blocked off this era and it's called the 19th Century Era.
 
This era is a very different game than we know today.
People seeing this game would wonder what kind of funny rules
we're going on.
Because this period, this 19th Century Era, was a time of many, many changes
to the rules.
Let's run through a few just so you get a sense of the history of baseball
and how it's different in the 19th Century Era.
So for example, in 1877, they made a major change in the rule.
They eliminated the fair foul hit.
The fair foul hit was where-- if this is a baseball diamond, if the batter would
hit the ball and the first bounce would be in fair territory,
but then maybe the ball would spin off and bounce into foul territory
even before first base, that would be considered a hit, or a fair ball.
So this is very different than today's game.
As baseball fans know, fair balls now have to travel beyond first base
if they're going to be on the ground.
And if they're in the air beyond first base,
they have to touch first in fair territory.
So these are the new rules, the modern rules,
but in 1877, you were able to somehow manipulate
the ball so it would hit in fair territory in front
of either first or third base on the infield.
And if it could skip out of bounds, you could easily maybe make it to first,
maybe make it to second.
Another change starting in 1880 was the reduction
of the number of balls-- the number of called balls by the umpire
to reach base on balls, a walk.
The number of called balls to reach a walk reduced in 1880.
It used to be nine called balls would get you a base on balls.
So in 1880, it went from nine to eight.
And it continued dropping down until the modern day four called balls
reaching a base on balls.
That went all the way until 1889.
In 1889, it was settled on four.
Four called balls reached first base by the batter, four called balls reached
a walk.
Let's review other major changes that occurred in professional baseball
during the 19th Century Era.
In 1883, they allowed pitchers to use shoulder high deliveries.
So the pitcher delivery changed by allowing shoulder high deliveries.
Before that, you had to deliver the ball below your waist.
In 1885, bats could be flat on one side.
They created the rule allowing bats to be flat, much more like a cricket bat.
 
But they went and changed that back to be just rounded bats in 1893.
They went back on that in 1893.
This is a big one.
 
This is a very big change.
In 1887-- up until 1886, the batter could call high or low.
The batter could tell the pitcher, I want a high strike or a low strike.
Batter called the pitching zone.
 
After that, they changed the strike zone.
In 1887, they changed the strike zone to be
much more like what we know today-- sort of shoulders to knees.
It actually changed over the years, but it was much more recognizable from 1887
on.
In 1893, they moved to a pitching rubber, which is modern today.
The pitchers got to start on the pitching rubber,
but back then, it was a pitcher's box and it was 50 feet away from the plate.
In 1893, they established that the pitching rubber
had to be 60 feet 6 inches away from home plate, just like it is today.
It just was implemented in 1893 that you weren't
charged with an at bat when you performed a sacrifice.
 
Finally, in 1898, the balk rule was created
and they started recording stolen bases.
So in 1898, they created the balk rule.
The balk rule was implemented because this way pitchers weren't
able to as easily deceive the base runners.
 
So that was some of the major changes that occur during the 19th Century Era.
Bottom line, the 19th Century Era is when
we see the evolution of the rules of the game
and it becomes much more similar to the game as we know it.
Because of the frequent and often crazy rule changes
that occurred during the 19th century, we consider the Modern Era anything
after that.
1901 on is the Modern Era.
It's called the Modern Era of baseball.
So before that, it's the Protoball or the 19th Century Era.
