ANDY ANDRES: Let's look at another article
written by Hugh Fullerton in 1910, published in The American Magazine,
which again shows his early attempts at some sabermetrics.
This article is called "The Inside Game, the Science, the Science of Baseball."
Here's one of the figures in the article written by Fullerton.
What he's trying to show in this doctored photograph are grooves.
He calls them grooves.
There's infield grooves here, here, here, and then down the lines.
There's five infield grooves.
And then there's home run grooves here and here.
And then there's these safety zones for bunts here and here.
Based on his observation of the game, hard hit ground errors
on the infield grooves make it through for hits.
These are the areas in the outfield where your chances of outfield hits
go up.
And these are the areas where you have the better
chances of getting on base with a safe bunt.
Grooves are places where the ball ought to go safe.
The batter should be able to get on base.
This is looking at fielders' range and their ability
to cover parts of the field, and then looking at batters' ability
to hit the ball in certain areas of the field, or certain zones of the field.
Now one of the things that he points out here, a big piece of his article
that he's bringing up is something he calls
teamwork, teamwork of the defense.
Fullerton looks at score sheets of college games,
some various levels of the minor leagues,
and then of course, major league baseball games
that he's scoring himself.
So looking at these different levels of baseball,
he tries to measure the number of balls that
get through the infield on the ground as a measure of the teamwork
of the defense, the teamwork of the defense.
So let's look at those data.
So Fullerton recorded ground ball data, play by play ground ball data
at the college level, at a low level of minor league baseball called
the Central League, so a lower minor league baseball team,
the American Association, which was a higher minor league baseball
team, and then data from the major leagues.
And what he found analyzing the ground ball data in each of these levels
is that one out of eight ground balls made it through the infield for a hit.
One out of eight ground balls in college made it through the infield for a hit.
When he look at a low level minor league set of data, it was one out of 10.
One out of 10 ground balls made it through the infield for a hit.
At a higher level of minor league baseball, it was 12.
One out of 12 ground balls made it through the infield for a hit.
And in the majors, it was one out of 15.
One out of 15 ground balls made it through the infield to become a hit.
Ground balls struck by the batter made it through the infield as a hit.
Now you can see that these numbers are increasing,
meaning that the defense was getting better and better
at fielding the ground balls hit by the batters.
Now of course, it could be the skill of the pitcher.
Maybe the pitcher here is a better pitcher,
inducing more weak ground balls.
 
Fullerton rejects that.
He thinks it was about the same.
But what he ascribes this improvement in team defense,
infield defense-- he calls it teamwork of the defense.
And essentially, he says it's positioning, which makes sense.
Maybe you position the infielders in the right spot.
But more than that, he calls it signaling.
And he goes on to describe how teams signal
each other to position themselves and anticipate where the ball's going
to be hit, based on what the pitcher is going to pitch,
the type of pitch he's going to pitch, the location he's going to pitch it.
The infielders anticipate where to go.
So the primary objective in signaling, according to Fullerton,
is to enable the defensive players to start in the direction of the ball
that it's expected to be hit.
And as players move up the system towards the major leagues,
they develop much better signaling habits and anticipation
of where the ball is going to be hit.
Therefore, they're going to field more ground balls
and reduce the number of hits, reduce the number
of hits that go through to the outfield.
He essentially says that as you move up to higher levels of baseball,
you reduce the grooves.
The grooves get smaller because of teamwork.
Very interesting sabermetrics.
Makes complete intuitive sense.
But Fullerton observed something and gathered data
to try to support his observations and answer his questions.
He was truly acting like a sabermetrician.
 
Another very interesting thing that Fullerton
reports in this article in The American Magazine is the data shown here.
These are his diagrams showing the range of the left fielder, center fielder,
right fielder, and then all the infielders
and how they respond to various batted balls.
He's diagramming the range of each of the fielders based on his observation.
So he kept track of the movements of various players.
And one of his big conclusions is that the outfielders
and the middle infielders actually move better going forward.
There's more distance covered if they're going forward towards home plate,
as opposed to backwards away from home plate.
That's one of his observations.
But here we get a diagram looking at the range covered
by each of the defenders on the field.
As MLB advances technology, we're going to get much more precise data,
much more accurate data about the range of various defenders in baseball.
 
Another diagram he shows is the movement of one second baseman
throughout the game on various kinds of plays.
He graphs it here as different innings.
There's different innings in his diagram.
But you can see that the second baseman has different starting positions,
depending on the situation of the game.
You know, he does this funny calculation of the actual distance
covered by the second baseman.
So for the first time, we're getting better range data
and certainly reporting of range and movements of defenders on the field.
Now finally, the last thing that Fullerton covers
is looking at batted ball data.
He looked at 10,074 batted balls in his score sheets.
Any he broke them down into ground balls, fly balls, line drives,
and bunts.
Ground balls, fly balls, line drives, and bunts.
So out of the 10,074 batted balls, he recorded 51% were ground balls,
36% were fly balls, 9% were line drives, and 3% were bunts.
Now in 2013, this is 2013 data reported at Baseball Reference,
there were about about 42,000 batted balls in 2013.
And the percentages again for ground ball, fly ball, line drive, and bunt
were pretty similar to what Fullerton reports.
In 2013, it was 45% ground balls, 29% fly balls, 24% line drives,
and 2% bunts.
This is what's reported on Baseball Reference for 2013.
So you see that they are comparable.
Obviously, there's more data collected in 2013 than Fullerton had.
But this is an awful lot of batted ball data
that Fullerton collects and analyzes.
And he's pretty close to what we see.
The line drives are little off but otherwise,
it's near what we measure today in modern baseball.
 
Now what's interesting are the batting averages
reported for each of these things.
So I'm going to list here the batting average on each of these batted ball
types that Fullerton reports.
The batting average reported on ground balls for Fullerton
was 82, not a great batting average.
The fly ball batting average was 207.
The line drive batting average from Fullerton was 774.
And the bunt batting average according to Fullerton was 450.
So 82-- 082 if you want to put the decimals there--
082 batting average for ground balls, 207, 774, and 450.
Well, how does that compare to modern baseball?
Well, ground ball batting average in 2013 was 167, fly balls were 241,
line drives were 670, and the bunts in modern baseball were 407.
So these are modern batting averages.
And batting averages were also reported by Fullerton.
That's why we use batting average as a comparison.
The point is it's in the ballpark.
It's pretty close.
It's not exact.
But Fullerton did this over 100 years ago,
collecting these batted ball data to try to better understand
how the different batted ball types impact batting performance as measured
by batting average.
So there's Hugh Fullerton, writer, forecaster, scientist,
and sabermetrician.
I don't think he's appreciated as much as he
should be by modern sabermetricians and fans of the game.
