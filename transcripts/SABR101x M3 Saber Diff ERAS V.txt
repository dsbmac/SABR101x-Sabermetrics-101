ANDY ANDRES: So as we think of the run scoring environment
changes throughout the time of major league baseball,
inevitably you're going to start talking about some of the other things
we measure in the game to help explain some of the differences.
For example, small ball or "scientific baseball," as it used to be called.
The Earl Weaver strategies of hitting home runs, power ball.
Let's look at the data that helps us understand
how the game might have changed over time.
Here is a graph of home runs in the modern era.
This is home runs per game by a team.
And we can see there's this gradual increase over the past 110 years
from about one home run every five games or so during the dead-ball era,
with our little spike year when the ball changes.
And then the transition to new rules about pitching,
Babe Ruth obviously, and the new rules about replacing
the ball to another era, the live-ball era, where home runs increase
to about one every two games or so.
And then, of course, we have the war years where the game is in transition,
and there's a little change in home run power.
But then we have the integration era following
the war, where we get another rise in home run rates,
so we're getting close to about 0.9 home runs per game in the '50s and '60s.
And then, expansion happens.
And when we look at the home run rates during this expansion era,
we see it's much more random, much more variable.
And this could be explained by expansion itself,
the potential dilution of talent.
But then we get this very distinct place here, the power era,
where home runs are over one a game.
Now let's review what's happened since 2010.
In 2010, the home runs per game were 0.95-- 0.95 home runs per game.
At 2011, that went to 0.94.
2012, it went to 1.02, and then 2013, we had 0.96.
As you can see, that sort of stabilized right about here.
Now it's lower than the power era, but it's sort of stabilized right here.
A very obvious trend though is the increasing home runs over time.
This is certainly happening.
So home runs are a bigger part of the game then they used to be.
Back in this day, they used to be called scientific baseball, or small ball.
This is the small ball era, some people called it scientific baseball,
but you can see the game is much different.
The game that Hugh Fullerton and F.C. Lane talk a lot about
is this time right here.
But let's move on to a description of three different variables.
We're describing here home runs per game in the blue diamonds,
and we saw that trend here, an increasing trend.
We even showed the data before the modern era, in the 19th century.
We look at stolen bases that were recorded and also
sacrifice hits, OK, bunts.
And you can see that stolen bases were much more prominent in the 19th century
game, but as we look at the modern era-- we'll
look at this at just the modern era.
There are bigger trends going on here in terms of stolen bases, bunting,
and home run hitting.
One big one is the obvious decreasing trend of bunts over time,
stabilizing to about 0.3 per game.
And you can see in the small ball scientific era
a lot more stolen bases occurred, and it sort of increased a little bit,
and then sort of stabilized here.
And we already saw the home run rate increase in the blue diamond trend.
Let's look at this in just the modern era.
And here we have the data from the modern era, again the home run trend.
And then, of course, this time when there was more bunting going on.
Then it decreased dramatically and sort of stabilized to a lower bunting era,
bunting a lot less now.
And then obviously, the shifting stolen base trend over time.
So you're a sabermetrician, you're a data scientist.
Observe these data, think about what they might mean.
Think about what it says about the game and how it's played,
and how to potentially win the game, and/or play the game differently
with different strategy.
That's what sabermetrics is, the scientific approach
toward understanding the game of baseball better.
One other trend that is very interesting in the game, in the modern era,
is the strikeout rate, strikeouts per nine innings.
There is an increasing trend.
Very much like the home run rate, there's an increasing strikeout rate.
Strikeout rates were about four per game three
to four per game in the dead-ball era.
In the live-ball era, they decreased to certainly three to four
per game, a little slight decrease from the dead-ball era.
There was a decrease.
Then, of course, the war years didn't change much
in terms of strikeout rates, but there's this increasing strikeout
rate through the integration era.
There's an increasing strikeout rate through the integration era.
And it's interesting to consider potential causes for this, again.
Let this be a discussion forum topic if you
want to explore potential hypotheses here
about why there's this increasing trend in strikeouts during the integration
era.
And then during the expansion era from the '60s to the mid '90s,
this area here, we see sort of a dip in strikeouts
and then an increase in strikeouts that continued
through the power era and even today.
Let's review strikeout rates.
Since this graph was made in 2010, the last point here,
the strikeout rate was 7.06 k/9.
2011, 7.1 k/9.
2012, 7.5, a real increase, it looks significant,
and then 2013 we're up to 7.55 strikeouts per 9.
So there was this leap in strikeouts, and it's trended up to here.
We're right about here now.
This trend has sort of continued.
Let's observe these data, and consider what
might have caused this increase during the integration era.
What might have caused this increase during the expansion era
and into the beginning part of the power era?
You could potentially say that there's some stability in strikeout
rates during the power era, but now we're
seeing another increase in strikeout rates.
What are potential causes, potential hypotheses or explanations
for these trends in the data?
When we look at both graphs together, the increasing home
run rate and the increasing strikeout rate,
it makes you think that they go together.
Well, what does that mean?
What are potential explanations, potential hypotheses
for why these might go together?
And this is what a sabermetrician asks, that's a question that they're
trying to explore.
So since we see these increasing trends we might think that they go together.
And when we think they go together, we might
want to plot the data in a bivariate fashion, which
is the lesson later on this week.
So let's look at this graph where we're plotting on the x-axis each
of the year's average home runs per game.
 
And remember, over one is the power era, so here is the power era data.
And, of course, that's where we had the highest strikeout rates, too.
Strikeout rates are plotted on the y-axis.
And as we look over all the data in the modern era for every dot,
every point here represents a year, the average of all teams' home run rates
and all teams' strikeout rates.
We can see that there is a trend here, and we
can look again at the R squared variable.
R squared is the coefficient of determination.
We talked about that in an earlier video in this course,
and it just describes how two variables are related to one another.
And there does seem to be a relationship between strikeouts and home runs.
Higher strikeout rates go with higher home run rates.
Lower strikeout rates go with lower home run rates.
But hopefully through this segment, you've
got a better sense of the changing run scoring environments that
have occurred through baseball since the start of professional baseball in 1871.
